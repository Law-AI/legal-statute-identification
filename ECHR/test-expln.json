                "5.  The applicants were born in 1981 and 1966 respectively and live in Ecemi\u015f village near the town of Lice, located with the administrative jurisdiction of the province of Diyarbak\u0131r.",
                "6.  The facts of the case as submitted by the parties, and as they appear from the documents submitted by them, may be summarised as follows.",
                "7.  At the time of the events the first applicant\u2019s brother and the second applicant\u2019s nephew Murat Tekdal was thirty years old and lived in Ecemi\u015f village.",
                "8.  On 12 September 2008 Murat Tekdal returned to his village of Ecemi\u015f after having visited his uncle, the second applicant. Later the same day he left his home to walk to the nearby \u015eenlik village.",
                "9.  Between 5 and 7 p.m. the same day, villagers in Ecemi\u015f village heard gunfire. The following day the headman of the village (\u201cmuhtar\u201d) was informed that a person had been killed. The headman, accompanied by 20\u201130 villagers, went to Lice, where he was handed the body of the applicants\u2019 relative, Murat Tekdal.",
                "10.  According to a report drawn up on 13 September 2008 by seven members of the military, a military operation was being carried out in the area near the applicants\u2019 village on 12 September 2008 when at 11.15 p.m. soldiers encountered 3-4 persons in the area whom they considered to be members of the PKK. The soldiers asked the persons to stop and surrender, but the persons opened fire on the soldiers. The soldiers returned fire and a clash ensued which continued for a period of approximately five minutes.",
                "11.  At 5 a.m. the following morning the soldiers conducted a search in the area and noticed the footsteps of four persons. The footsteps disappeared some two kilometres away, next to a little brook in a valley. At that location the soldiers also found supplies of food. The soldiers continued their search to the north of the brook, and found the body of Murat Tekdal in Kara\u00e7ay hill area. Next to the body was a hunting rifle still loaded with two unexploded cartridges.",
                "12.  The soldiers concluded in their report that there had been five PKK members in the area the previous evening who had either been planning to attack the security forces or transporting food supplies to PKK bases. Having regard to the particular brand of the glue which some people used for sniffing, as well as to the hunting rifle, the seven soldiers concluded in their report that the applicant\u2019s relative had been a \u201cterrorist posing as an ordinary citizen\u201d.",
                "13.  The Lice prosecutor and a crime scene officer arrived at the scene at 10.45 a.m. on 13 September 2008 and searched Murat Tekdal\u2019s pockets, where they found his identity card and a tube of glue. The body was then taken to the Lice State Hospital. They then took the body to the Diyarbak\u0131r State Hospital and subsequently drew up their own reports pertaining to the incident.",
                "14.  According to the crime scene officer\u2019s report, a bullet had entered Murat Tekdal\u2019s abdomen. A cursory examination of the barrel of the hunting rifle found next to the body did not reveal any smell of gunpowder. There were also no fingerprints on the rifle. In a small bag found next to the body there were personal effects such as toothpaste, a toothbrush, a flick-knife, a packet of cigarettes, two sim cards, gloves, a tax\u2011payer\u2019s identity card and a bank card. Swabs were taken from Murat Tekdal\u2019s hands and face and from the barrel of the hunting rifle, in order to verify the existence or otherwise of gunpowder residue. He was fingerprinted and his jacket through which the bullet had gone was sent for forensic analysis. The body was photographed and taken to the hospital. It was subsequently established by a police laboratory that there was gunpowder residue on the outside of his left hand. It was also established that he had been shot at close range.",
                "15.  It appears from the report prepared by the prosecutor that an autopsy was carried out at the hospital. The prosecutor stated in his report that he had gone to the scene after having been informed by the military that \u201ca terrorist had been killed\u201d. The headman of the applicant\u2019s village formally identified the body as that of Murat Tekdal, and told the prosecutor that Murat lived in Ecemi\u015f village.",
                "16.  During the autopsy the doctor observed two bullet holes on Murat Tekdal\u2019s lower left abdomen. He also noted that bullets had skimmed both hands and the lower right side of the abdomen and caused superficial injuries. There was also a superficial injury on the front of the right axilla. The internal examination of the body revealed injuries to the stomach, liver, diaphragm, spleen, intestines and lungs, all caused by bullets. A bullet measuring approximately 0.7 centimetres was found inside the body. Samples taken from the body were sent for further forensic analyses. An x\u2011ray of the body showed a large number of metallic objects inside the abdomen. The doctor concluded that death had been caused by bullets which had either entered or exited from the lower left abdomen. He also recommended that the clothes with bullet holes in them be sent to the forensic authorities with a view to determining the distance and the direction from which he had been shot.",
                "17.  On 16 September 2008 the second applicant applied to the Diyarbak\u0131r branch of the Human Rights Association of Turkey, and asked for assistance in bringing the perpetrators of the killing of his nephew to justice. He also stated that since the killing, soldiers had been setting fire to the area where his nephew had been killed, and deliberately destroying the evidence.",
                "18.  On 6 October 2008 the Lice prosecutor sent the investigation file to the Diyarbak\u0131r prosecutor who had jurisdiction to investigate incidents perpetrated by illegal organisations. In his letter accompanying the file the Lice prosecutor named the first applicant Fatma G\u00fcler as the \u201cvictim of a crime\u201d, and her deceased brother Murat Tekdal as the \u201cdeceased/suspect\u201d. The offence in question was stated as the \u201cdestruction of the unity and integrity of the State and the country\u201d. The Lice prosecutor stated in his letter that on the evening of 12 September 2008 a number of soldiers from the Lice Infantry Brigade had had an armed clash with a group of five PKK members and that the body of Murat Tekdal had been found in the search conducted by the soldiers the following morning.",
                "19.  On 22 October 2008 the Diyarbak\u0131r prosecutor decided not to bring any criminal proceedings against Murat Tekdal for the above-mentioned offence, because he was dead.",
                "20.  On 24 November 2008 the applicants sent a letter to the Diyarbak\u0131r prosecutor and stated that the Lice prosecutor had started an investigation into the killing of their relative, but had subsequently decided that he had no jurisdiction to continue the investigation because the deceased had been a member of a terrorist organisation. In their letter the applicants denied that their relative had been a member of the PKK, and informed the Diyarbak\u0131r prosecutor that their relative had been living in the village of Ecemi\u015f for the previous seven years and that all his fellow villagers knew him. They argued that there was no evidence to show that an armed clash had taken place prior to his killing. Indeed, the fact that his hunting rifle had been found loaded with unfired cartridges showed that there had been no armed clash. They asked the prosecutor to identify and prosecute those responsible for the killing of their relative.",
                "21.  On 5 October 2009 the applicants lodged an objection against the prosecutor\u2019s above-mentioned decision of 22 October 2008. In their objection petition they repeated their arguments of 24 November 2008 and referred to, inter alia, Article 2 of the Convention. They alleged that no effective investigation had been conducted into the killing, and urged the Assize Court to order the investigating authorities to carry out an investigation.",
                "22.  The applicants\u2019 objection was rejected by the Malatya Assize Court on 9 April 2010. The Assize Court stated that the prosecutor\u2019s decision had concerned an offence which the applicants\u2019 deceased relative was suspected of having committed. The objection lodged by the applicants, on the other hand, concerned the killing of their relative. The Assize Court stated that there was no on-going investigation into the killing of Murat Tekdal and that there had not been a decision not to prosecute anyone in respect of his killing. As there was no on-going investigation into the killing, the applicants had no standing to bring an objection against the Diyarbak\u0131r prosecutor\u2019s decision. The Assize Court\u2019s decision was communicated to the applicants on 30 April 2010."

                "5.  The applicant was born in 1976 and lives in Budapest.",
                "6.  On 20 July 2015 a quarrel broke out between the applicant and his common-law wife, H.M. The latter called an ambulance because the applicant was under the influence of alcohol and was behaving oddly, and had a violent outburst.",
                "7.  At about 4.40 p.m., instead of an ambulance, police officers E.Sz. and T.Z. appeared at the applicant\u2019s flat, handcuffed the applicant and took him to the Orosh\u00e1za police department, arriving there at about 5.10 p.m.",
                "8.  According to the applicant he had no injuries when he was put into the police car. He was allegedly assaulted at the police station. While he was handcuffed and in the room for short-term arrestees, one of the three police officers present either kicked or pushed him from behind onto the floor. He hit his face and nose, which started to bleed. He also suffered injuries to his teeth. He fainted and when he regained consciousness, about fifteen minutes later, he found himself handcuffed to a bench, his knees hurting. His request for help was allegedly disregarded by the police officers at first, but when it became apparent that he could not walk, he was taken to hospital.",
                "9.  At 7.45 p.m. the applicant was examined by Dr CS.H. at Orosh\u00e1za Hospital. He had bruises on the bridge of his nose and around his two wrists, abrasions on his right thigh, scratches below his left knee, and his left tibia was broken. He was hospitalised following the examination.",
                "10.  On 22 July 2015 the applicant was examined by Dr CS.H. of the Department of Traumatology, and further injuries were noted on his body: bruises on his upper left arm, an abrasion around the right side of his collar\u2011bone, scratches around the left side of his collar-bone, bruises on both sides of his hips, two loose teeth, one broken and one missing tooth in the upper jaw.",
                "11.  The head of Orosh\u00e1za police station of his own motion filed a criminal complaint against unknown perpetrators alleging \u201cill-treatment committed in the course of official proceedings\u201d. The Central Investigation Office opened an investigation into ill-treatment committed in the course of official proceedings, assault causing actual bodily harm, and grievous bodily harm.",
                "12.  In his testimony the applicant stated that he had been kicked from behind when taken into custody. At that time he had been handcuffed and had fallen onto his face on the floor, as a consequence of which his nose had started to bleed. He explained that he had remained unconscious for 15\u201120 minutes and when he had regained consciousness, his nose had been bleeding and he had felt pain in his knee. He had asked for help, but only when the police officers realised that he was unable to stand unaided had he been taken to hospital.",
                "13.  H.M. was questioned as a witness. Describing the circumstances of the incident before the police arrived she stated that the applicant had not mentioned to her before the incident that he had hurt his leg. She also stated that on the day of the incident the applicant had been found by her daughter lying on the kitchen floor. She confirmed the applicant\u2019s version of events in so far as she maintained that she had seen no injuries on the applicant when he was put into the police car.",
                "14.  K.B., the daughter of H.M., also questioned as a witness, stated that on 20 July 2015 at around 12.30 p.m. she had found the applicant lying on the kitchen floor and not breathing. She proceeded to wake him up and could tell that he had been drinking alcohol. She had also seen the applicant earlier that day falling over in the yard, but he had sustained only minor injuries to his arm and leg.",
                "15.  According to the police report, when the police officers arrived at the applicant\u2019s flat, the applicant was sitting on the floor and was unable to communicate. He did not identify himself, despite the officers\u2019 order. When the police officers tried to handcuff him, he resisted, swinging his head from side to side. He fell to the ground and his nose started bleeding. He could only be put in the police car with the use of force, and when inside it he kept insulting the police officers. At the police station he continued to behave aggressively and tried to hit his head against the floor. He therefore had to be handcuffed and laid on the floor. He was not injured during these measures and his handcuffs were removed when he calmed down at around 7 p.m. He refused to be examined by a doctor.",
                "16.  The Central Investigation Office also questioned E.Sz. and T.Z. and two other police officers who had been on duty at the police station at the time of the applicant\u2019s placement in the room for short-term arrestees, and a third officer who had come on duty at around 6 p.m. the same day. E.Sz. and T.Z. confirmed what was in the police report and the other three witnesses denied any knowledge of ill-treatment having been inflicted on the applicant. They all stated that the applicant had been drunk and had been handcuffed to prevent him causing harm to himself.",
                "17.  The two members of the medical staff of Orosh\u00e1za Hospital who had been present during the applicant\u2019s treatment could not recall the event in detail but remembered that the applicant had not complained about ill\u2011treatment by the police officers and, although limping, was able to walk unaided to the x-ray examination room.",
                "18.  On 1 November 2015 the medical expert appointed by the Central Investigation Office expressed the opinion that the applicant\u2019s leg had been broken one or two weeks prior to the incident and that it could not be determined whether the injuries to his teeth had been caused before or during his detention for questioning at the police station. According to the expert opinion, it was implausible that the applicant would have been capable of reconstructing the events of the day, owing to his drunkenness.",
                "19.  On 17 December 2015 the Central Investigation Office discontinued the criminal proceedings for lack of any conclusive evidence (as regards ill\u2011treatment committed in the course of official proceedings and assault causing actual bodily harm) and for the absence of a crime (as regards causing grievous bodily harm). According to the Investigation Office, it could not be established which injuries occurred during the police measures and whether they were caused by ill-treatment or the applicant\u2019s own behaviour. The decision also stated that the applicant\u2019s tibia could not have been broken during the incident and that the applicant\u2019s credibility was questionable due to his drunkenness.",
                "20.  The applicant filed a complaint against the discontinuation order. He maintained that his colleagues and supervisors, as well as the members of his household could have confirmed that he had no leg injury before the incident if they were heard as witnesses or if specific questions were put to them in this regard. He also submitted that Dr CS.H. (see paragraph 9 above) had been biased and questioned the credibility of the statement in the expert opinion of 1 November 2015 concerning his drunkenness (see paragraph 18 in fine above).",
                "21.  On 18 February 2016 the chief prosecutor\u2019s office dismissed the complaint. It endorsed the first-instance decision concerning the assessment of evidence and the legal classification thereof, informing the applicant of the possibility of pursuing substitute private prosecution proceedings."

                "5.  The applicant was born in 1969 and lives in Benevento.",
                "6.  On 2 April 2013, between 1 and 1.15 p.m., the applicant was stopped by two officers of the Benevento municipal police while she was driving her car.",
                "7.  According to the applicant, the police officers checked her driver\u2019s licence and her vehicle documents. An argument broke out between the applicant and the officers. In the applicant\u2019s view, her nervous and hostile attitude led the police officers to suspect that she was intoxicated, which she denied. As the officers did not have the necessary equipment to perform a breathalyser test, they requested the assistance of the road police (Polizia Stradale). The applicant returned to her car. Once she had got back into the vehicle, one of the police officers pulled the car door open and dragged her out by the arm.",
                "8.  As recorded in the municipal police officers\u2019 report of 3 April 2013, the applicant had been stopped because she had been driving in an erratic manner, braking suddenly and changing lanes abruptly. The applicant did not seem to be able to exit the vehicle by herself and had had to be assisted by one of the officers. The officers reported that they had smelt alcohol on her breath and that she had been unsteady on her feet. The applicant had insulted and threatened them.",
                "9.  At 1.30 p.m. traffic police officers arrived on the scene with the breathalyser equipment.",
                "10.  According to the applicant, she was not able to take the test because she was in a state of anxiety that had been exacerbated by one of the officers shouting at her that she was drunk. That had caused her to tremble and had meant she could not keep the breathalyser tube in her mouth. The applicant requested that carabinieri be called to the scene, but the request was denied.",
                "11.  According to the traffic police report (annotazione di servizio della Polizia Stradale), the applicant agreed to be breathalysed, but did not blow into the device in the manner she had been told to do by the officers and refused to cooperate. At one point she had thrown the device\u2019s mouthpiece into the face of one of the officers. The applicant was described as being in a \u201cclearly altered\u201d state, smelling strongly of alcohol and staggering.",
                "12.  The applicant was taken to the municipal police station (Comando di Polizia Municipale), where she arrived at approximately 1.50 p.m.",
                "13.  According to the applicant, once at the station the lieutenant on duty started drafting an offence report (verbale di contestazione) for driving under the influence of alcohol. The two officers who had stopped her in the street and escorted her to the station and another officer were also present. She repeatedly requested that she be allowed to use a telephone to let her family and her lawyer know of her whereabouts but her requests were denied. When she tried to pick up a telephone, one of the officers hit her in order to make her sit down. The same officer twisted her arms behind her back and handcuffed her, hurting her wrists. He then squeezed her buttocks and asked her if the handcuffs were tight enough. The applicant started screaming loudly and the officer removed the handcuffs in a violent manner. In doing so, he fractured the applicant\u2019s right thumb and caused other injuries to her wrists. He then warned her not to cause further trouble and threatened her. The applicant left the station between 2.15 and 2.30 p.m. and proceeded further on foot as her car had been seized.",
                "14.  As recorded in the joint report issued on 3 April 2013 by the two municipal police officers who had stopped her in the street and the lieutenant on duty at the municipal police station, upon her arrival at the station the applicant had started threatening and insulting them. When the lieutenant started drafting the offence report, she grabbed a telephone from a desk and ran into the corridor. When the lieutenant tried to stop her, the applicant pushed him violently, causing him to fall. She then threw the telephone out of the window. The applicant, who was in an extremely agitated state, pushed and kicked the other two officers, and they eventually handcuffed her. When the applicant calmed down, the handcuffs were removed. The applicant ran out of the station, leaving her bag and personal belongings behind. Her vehicle and driver\u2019s licence had been seized under road traffic legislation. The same account of the events is recorded in the offence notification (informativa di reato) filed by the directing commander of the Benevento municipal police with the Benevento public prosecutor on 3 April 2013.",
                "15.  According to the applicant, once she had left the station she got a lift to the emergency department of a local hospital, where she was examined.",
                "16.  At approximately 8 p.m. the applicant went to the State Police and attempted, unsuccessfully, to lodge a criminal complaint against the municipal police officers. According to the report of the officer on duty, the applicant complained that she had been assaulted by Benevento municipal police officers and that her finger had been fractured. When the officer informed her that the she could not file a criminal complaint because the station was closed, the applicant started speaking incoherently in a loud voice. Given her nervous and agitated state, the officer called the local questura (police headquarters) for backup. The applicant requested that an ambulance be called. The ambulance arrived at 8.30 p.m. and the applicant was examined by the ambulance medics. She was taken home by ambulance at approximately 9 p.m.",
                "17.  On 4 April 2013 the applicant lodged a criminal complaint against the two police officers who had stopped her in the street on 2 April 2013 and the other two officers who had been present at the municipal police station, but whose names she did not know, alleging assault and battery, infliction of bodily harm, abuse of office, and threats.",
                "18.  An investigation into the applicant\u2019s allegations was initiated. Seven people identified by the applicant as witnesses (persone informate sui fatti) were interviewed. Two were people who stated they had seen one of the officers dragging the applicant out of her vehicle. One was the owner of a bar where the applicant had gone in order to call her former spouse once she had left the hospital on 2 April 2013. Another was the applicant\u2019s former spouse, who stated that her alcohol intake was limited to consumption during meals. He further stated that because of a traumatic event in her life the applicant became agitated, trembled and had trouble expressing herself when subjected to stress. The other three were colleagues, who stated that the applicant had not appeared to be intoxicated when she had left her office on 2 April 2013. The police officers who had allegedly been involved in the ill-treatment were not interviewed, and neither was the applicant.",
                "19.  On 17 January 2014 the public prosecutor requested that the proceedings be discontinued. The basis of the request was that \u201cthe allegations in the criminal complaint are not confirmed by the statements made by the witnesses identified by the victim\u201d.",
                "20.  On 27 February 2014 the applicant lodged an objection against the prosecutor\u2019s request to discontinue the proceedings. She complained about the lack of reasoning in the prosecutor\u2019s request and alleged that the investigation had not been thorough. In that connection, she complained about the \u201ctotal absence\u201d of investigative measures with respect to the events that had occurred at the municipal police station and requested that the investigating judge order such measures without delay. Moreover, the applicant complained that she had not been questioned and requested that she be interviewed immediately. She also requested that officials interview the person who had taken her to the hospital when she had left the police station and other individuals. She also challenged the credibility of the official police reports, as they were in stark contrast with her account of the impugned events.",
                "21.  At a hearing on 22 September 2014 the applicant\u2019s lawyer repeated the complaints and requests contained in the objection against the prosecutor\u2019s request to discontinue the proceedings and reiterated, in particular, the request to conduct an investigation into the events that had occurred at the municipal police station.",
                "22.  By an order of 3 October 2014, served on the applicant on 27 October 2014, the Benevento District Court preliminary investigations judge (giudice per le indagini preliminari) decided to discontinue the proceedings. The order stated that the evidence gathered during the preliminary investigation had not been sufficient to warrant indicting the officers. It stated that the victim\u2019s allegations had not been corroborated by evidence and that further investigative measures, as requested by the victim, would have \u201cno influence whatsoever\u201d.",
                "23.  On 25 October 2013 the applicant was charged with a number of offences in connection with the events of 2 April 2013, including resisting a police officer, insulting a public official, and driving under the influence of alcohol. The applicant was also charged with causing bodily harm to a police officer.",
                "24.  On an unspecified date, the public prosecutor and the applicant reached a plea agreement with respect to the offence of bodily harm and requested that the judge proceed with the imposition of a sentence (applicazione della pena su richiesta delle parti).",
                "25.  On 21 November 2014 the Benevento preliminary hearings judge took note of the plea agreement and gave the applicant a suspended sentence of twenty-eight days\u2019 imprisonment. On the same day, the preliminary hearings judge suspended the proceedings against the applicant in connection with the charges of resisting a police officer, insulting a public official and driving under the influence of alcohol. The applicant was placed on probation with a requirement that she perform community service.",
                "26.  On 2 April 2013, the applicant went to the emergency department of a local hospital. At 6.42 p.m. she was examined by a radiologist, who established that her right thumb was fractured.",
                "27.  On 3 April 2013 the applicant returned to the emergency department. According to the medical report, the applicant arrived at the hospital in an agitated state, complaining about pain in several parts of her body. She was examined by a doctor who noted the presence of a splint on her right hand to treat a fracture. The doctor further noted the presence of bruising resulting from traumatic injury (trauma contusivo con ecchimosi) to the right thigh, right shoulder and left wrist.",
                "28.  On 4 April 2013 the applicant went to a different hospital. She was examined by an orthopaedist, who confirmed the fracture of the thumb and the presence of bruises on her left thigh and on her back. The doctor recommended surgery to treat the fracture.",
                "29.  Owing to a traumatic event in her life, the applicant suffers from chronic post-traumatic stress disorder, which has evolved into a major depressive disorder. She also suffers from a disorder which is characterised by mood swings which are exacerbated in times of particular stress, by the consumption of alcohol or sleep deprivation. The disorder in question includes peaks of manic behaviour when the applicant loses contact with reality and experiences a sense of impending threat to her own safety and that of those around her. The applicant was prescribed drugs for insomnia in February 2013. Combining the drugs with even moderate amounts of alcohol can have the same consequences as excessive alcohol consumption."

                "6.  The applicant was born in 1954. He lived in the Republic of Dagestan and was the mayor of Makhachkala between 1998 and 2013. He is currently detained in correctional colony no. 6 in Orenburg Region (\u201cthe correctional colony\u201d).",
                "7.  In June 2013 the applicant was arrested and placed in custody pending criminal proceedings against him. He suffered from several illnesses, including a urinary condition, a rectal prolapse, hepatitis C, and type 2 diabetes. He was confined to a wheelchair and had to use catheters and enemas to urinate and defecate.",
                "8.  On 12 August 2013 he lodged an application with the Court complaining that he was not receiving adequate medical assistance in detention. Four days later the Court indicated to the Russian Government under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court that he should be examined by medical experts.",
                "9.  On 27 November 2014 the Court delivered a judgment in the case, finding, inter alia, that there had been violations of Articles 3 and 34 of the Convention on account of the authorities\u2019 failure to provide the applicant with adequate medical care or to comply with the interim measure indicated (see Amirov v. Russia, no. 51857/13, \u00a7\u00a7 75, 93, and 94, 27 November 2014).",
                "10.  Relying on Article 46 of the Convention the Court held that the authorities should admit the applicant, at that time detained in remand prison no. 4 in Rostov-on-Don, to a specialised medical facility where he should remain under constant medical supervision and should be provided with adequate medical services corresponding to his needs; alternatively, the authorities could place him in a specialised prison medical facility, if the facility could guarantee the requisite level of medical supervision and care. (see Amirov, cited above, \u00a7 118).",
                "11.   After 27 November 2014, the date of the Court\u2019s judgment in the applicant\u2019s first case, he continued being detained in the remand prison pending the completion of his trial.",
                "12.  According to the information from the Government, in 2014 the applicant\u2019s cell was re-equipped to take account of his needs as a wheelchair user. Handrails were installed near his bed and the toilet, and the furniture was put at a lower level in order to be accessible. Wheelchair ramps and a lift were installed in the detention facility. A room for personal-hygiene procedures needed by the applicant was located opposite his cell with all the necessary equipment.",
                "13.  In 2015 he was examined by various doctors, such as a general practitioner, a neurologist, a surgeon, a urologist, and a proctologist. He underwent basic medical tests and received the treatment he had been prescribed. The prison doctors found his overall condition to be satisfactory.",
                "14.  The applicant\u2019s lawyers noticed, however, that his state of health had worsened. They solicited medical opinions on the treatment required.",
                "15.  On 14 July 2015 Dr W., a specialist in neurology, examined the applicant. He noted progressive muscular dystrophy, the development of leg convulsions, and urinary problems. An immediate admission to a specialised hospital for long-term treatment and urological surgery was recommended. The doctor said that further detention in prison would put the applicant\u2019s life at risk.",
                "16.  On 30 October 2015 the applicant was examined by a forensic expert, Dr N., who confirmed the deterioration of his medical condition, and noted the development of bedsores. The doctor suggested that the applicant\u2019s state of health might warrant early release on medical grounds and stated that he needed constant medical care.",
                "17.  On 22 January 2016 Dr N. assessed the quality of the medical care in the remand prison. He noted the absence of exercise therapy, physiotherapy, and massage, and was concerned that the prison premises were not sterile enough for hygienic procedures.",
                "18.  In the meantime, on 27 August 2015 the Military Court of the North\u2011Caucasus Circuit found the applicant guilty of having organised an act of terrorism and an attempt to murder an investigator in his case. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in a high-security correctional colony. The Supreme Court of Russia upheld the conviction and sentence on 24 March 2016.",
                "19.  On 1 April 2016 the applicant was sent to serve his sentence in the correctional colony.",
                "20.   He spent the first two weeks of his detention in an ordinary cell in the quarantine wing. According to a letter from the chairman of the Committee for Civil Rights sent to the applicant\u2019s lawyer on 20 April 2016, the cell was not adapted to the needs of a wheelchair prisoner. The applicant depended on his fellow inmates, who assisted him in his daily needs, including helping him to perform enemas on himself.",
                "21.  Every day the applicant was taken, handcuffed and blindfolded, to the prison yard for exercise.",
                "22.  On 2 April 2016 he was examined by several prison doctors: a tuberculosis specialist, an infectious-diseases specialist, a dentist and a general practitioner. The latter recorded his illnesses, ordered blood and urine tests, and prescribed treatment, comprising of a special diet and drugs. He noted that the applicant needed regular catheterisation and enemas. Examinations by specialists in endocrinology, ophthalmology, gastroenterology, neurology, cardiology, urology, and surgery, and exercise therapy were recommended.",
                "23.  The applicant was regularly visited by the prison general practitioner in the quarantine wing and underwent blood and urine tests. The doctor was satisfied with his medical condition and the results of his treatment.",
                "24.  On 14 April 2016 the applicant was moved to medical unit no. 56 and placed in cell no. 12. He shared its space of 14 sq. m with one cellmate. The applicant was provided with a wide bed, a sink installed at a low level, and a medical couch, which he used during self-catheterisation procedures. Enemas were carried out in a separate room twice a week with the assistance of the medical unit staff. The custodial authorities continued handcuffing and blindfolding him while he was escorted to the yard.",
                "25.  On 11 May 2016 he was examined by several doctors: a general practitioner, an endocrinologist, a neurologist, and a urologist from the civilian hospital in Sol-Iletsk. According to the medical records kept by the doctors, his medical condition was acute. No recommendations for inpatient treatment or urgent medical measures were made. The endocrinologist ordered tests of his thyroid-gland hormones, which were carried out on the same day. The neurologist prescribed exercise. The latter prescription was endorsed by a prison doctor on 19 May 2016.",
                "26.   On 23 May 2016 the applicant was again examined by the endocrinologist, who noted, inter alia, the risk due to a low level of thyroid hormones. Another hormone test was prescribed for August 2016.",
                "27.  The applicant was examined by a medical board to establish whether he was entitled to early release on medical grounds. The board concluded that his medical condition did not warrant it.",
                "28.  From 6 to 8 June 2016 a commission of officials from the Russian Ombudsman\u2019s Office, the Orenburg Ombudsman\u2019s Office, the Orenburg prosecutor\u2019s office, the Federal Service of the Execution for Sentences in Orenburg Region and medical unit no. 56 came to the applicant\u2019s detention facility and examined the quality of his medical care. The commission concluded that it was adequate.",
                "29.  On 8 June 2016 the applicant was visited by an exercise-therapy specialist, who taught him exercises to support his health. It appears that this visit was a follow-up to previous visits by the specialist, in April and May 2016. However, the medical record does not disclose particular details of the recommendations made on those two previous occasions.",
                "30.  On 4 July 2016 two members of the Orenburg Regional Public Commission for Monitoring the Protection of Human Rights in Detention (\u041e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043d\u0430\u0431\u043b\u044e\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f \u041e\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438) inspected the colony. It appears that by the time of the inspection the applicant had been moved to another cell. The inspectors noted in particular, that the cell was divided into three sections by metal bars and housed six inmates. The applicant\u2019s section measured 10.8 sq. m; it had a bath, a medical couch, a sink, and a bedside table with television set. The toilet was not partitioned from the rest of the cell and the applicant could be observed by his cellmate while using it. The correctional colony lacked wheelchair ramps, so the applicant could not freely access the yard or meeting rooms. He complained that the necessary drugs had had to be supplied by his relatives, owing to a lack of funds, which were to be allocated in the near future. Medical supervision was carried out by the general practitioner as regular examinations by other specialists had not been considered necessary. Allegedly owing to the applicant not having received medical massages, the applicant\u2019s legs started convulsing. He was assisted by his cellmate, who helped him to get into bed. The applicant was not given a special diet.",
                "31.  On 11 August 25 October and 16 December 2016, and 19 April 2017 a special medical board of highly qualified civilian and prison doctors, and specialists in cardiology, endocrinology, neurology, and urology examined the applicant. They concluded that there was no need to admit the applicant to a specialist medical facility and that he could continue receiving treatment in the medical unit. The doctors were satisfied with the quality of medical care given to the applicant.",
                "32.  In the meantime the applicant\u2019s lawyer complained to the Ombudsman of the Russian Federation of the applicant\u2019s detention conditions and the poor quality of his medical treatment. The complaint was forwarded to the prosecutor\u2019s office for the supervision of detention facilities in Orenburg Region. Having carried out enquiries, on 5 July 2016 the Office replied as follows:\n\u201cIt has been established that on admission to [the correctional colony the applicant] was placed in [a cell of the quarantine wing]. It was designed for two persons and measured 12 sq. m, which satisfied the requirements of the Execution of Sentences Act ... [The applicant\u2019s] cellmate assisted him in his daily needs, which included hygienic procedures and moving around the cell. Accordingly, [the applicant] was not restricted in his rights ...\nThe allegation that [the applicant] was not provided with special conditions [needed in his situation] is not true. His cell in the medical unit is furnished with a specially designed table, a bed and a sink, so he can easily access them and move freely about the cell.\n[The applicant] is assisted by the medical unit staff members and inmates in his movements within the medical unit, in particular when entering/leaving buildings in a wheelchair, and in his daily needs.\nAs called for by [the applicant\u2019s] disability and illnesses, he is examined by the prison doctors on a daily basis, he receives medical treatment as prescribed to the relevant medical standards, and he is provided with dietary nutrition.\nIn May 2016 [the custodial authorities] provided him with a mattress [to prevent] bedsores.\n[The applicant] urinates with the help of a catheter which he inserts six to seven times per day (as recommended by [a urologist]). He defecates with the help of enemas performed every three days by medical staff from the medical unit. Detainees, who work in the medical unit, escort [the applicant] to a special room for that procedure and clean it afterwards.\nThe regional medical standard \u201cProcedures for simple medical procedures, desmurgy and immobilisation\u201d, approved by an Order of the Ministry of the Health Care and Social Development of Orenburg Region on 5 March 2010 does not require catheterisation or enemas to be carried out in a sterile room. Sterile catheters and enemas tips are used by [the applicant].\nIn breach of Article 30 of the Penal Institutions Act (Federal Law no. 5473-1 of 21 June 1993), [the applicant] was escorted for walks handcuffed and blindfolded until 24 May 2016.\nMoreover, the inquiry, which had been performed earlier, revealed breaches of Article 101 \u00a7 7 of the Russian Code on the Execution of Sentences and Articles 10, 11, and 11.1 of the Social Protection of the Disabled in the Russian Federation Act (Federal Law of 24 November 1995 No. 181-FZ). [In accordance with the aforementioned Regulation, the applicant] should have been given the necessary devices (a wheelchair for mobility, an indoor wheelchair, a gel pillow to prevent bedsores, nappies for adults, and urinals). However, the custodial authorities have not provided him with those items. [Moreover,] the detention facility did not take measures to provide the exercise and sport therapy [for the applicant] indicated in his rehabilitation programme.\nIn the light of the above, on 2 June 2016 the prosecutor\u2019s office for supervision of detention facilities in Orenburg issued a formal order to the head of the correctional colony to rectify the identified shortcomings. The order has been ... complied with ...\nThere are no grounds for a further intervention by the prosecutor ...\u201d"

The court then found that from 19 December 2009 to 19 December 2012 (the day when the applicant had submitted his complaint) he had had between 1.98 and 2.74 sq. m of personal space, in breach of the domestic standard of 3.1 sq. m.

Again, the court found that the sanitary conditions in the cells complied with relevant domestic hygiene norms, and dismissed as unproven the applicant\u2019s claims that his health had deteriorated.

On 11 April 2009, quoting the relevant sections of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Pest Central District Court ordered the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention on charges of terrorist acts and other related offences involving abuse of firearms and explosives on the grounds that he might abscond for fear of a severe punishment, might frustrate the on-going investigation by colluding with accomplices still at large, or might execute the planned offences or re-offend.",
                "6.  The detention measure was extended on 8 May and again on 7 August 2009. The court reiterated its earlier reasons, adding that the risk of collusion was serious, since certain other suspects had not yet been apprehended.",
                "7.  A further extension was ordered on 9 November 2009. The court stated that the applicant was being prosecuted for terrorist acts committed as an associate of an organised criminal group whose plans entailed a real risk of loss of life. It was of note that the group had existed for quite some time and had been committed to carrying out terrorist acts. Moreover, the volume of evidence supporting a reasonable suspicion, as weighed individually against the applicant, was increasing.",

On 9 June 2010 the Budapest Regional Court ordered that the applicant be held under house arrest, holding that the danger of his re-offending was not of a degree that justified his continued detention, noting also that the investigation was about to be wrapped up and that, in any case, some accomplices in the case had already been released pending trial.\nThe applicant was released from detention the next day.

                "12.  The measure was extended on 4 August 2010. In addition to the previously cited reasons, the court considered that there was no reason to assume that the applicant\u2019s political motivation behind the incriminated acts had subsided, which meant that the risk of re-offending was real.",

Following the submission of the indictment, on 18 May 2012 a three-judge panel of the Split County Court extended the pre-trial detention in respect of the applicant and the other accused relying on Article 123 \u00a7 1 (3) and (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (risk of reoffending and seriousness of charges). His pre-trial detention was extended several times on the same grounds. The reasoning of the relevant decisions is outlined in the \u0160o\u0161 case (cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 44, 47 and 52).",
                "12.  On 20 February 2013 the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske), acting as a court of appeal, found that the applicant\u2019s detention should be extended only under Article 123 \u00a7 1 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (risk of reoffending). It explained that the 2013 amendments to the Criminal Code provided that the offence at issue was punishable by a prison sentence of between three and fifteen years and no longer by long-term imprisonment. It was therefore not possible to remand the applicant on the grounds of the seriousness of the charges since the possibility of imposing a sentence of long-term imprisonment was one of the conditions for extending pre-trial detention under Article 123 \u00a7 1 (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (seriousness of charges).",
                "13.  On 20 April 2013 a three-judge panel of the Split County Court extended the pre-trial detention in respect of the applicant and the other accused under Article 123 \u00a7 1 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (risk of reoffending), without changing its previous reasoning.",
                "14.  On 17 May 2013 a three-judge panel of the Split County Court extended the maximum two-year statutory time-limit for the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention under Article 133 \u00a7 1 (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure for a further six months (until 19 November 2013) relying on section 35(2) of the Office for the Suppression of Corruption and Organised Crime Act (hereinafter \u201cthe OSCOCA\u201d).",
                "15.  The applicant appealed to the Supreme Court arguing that section 35(2) of the OSCOCA was inapplicable to his case since he was not detained during the investigation.",
                "16.  On 7 June 2013 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal on the grounds that the said provision of the OSCOCA made a mistaken reference to Article 130 \u00a7 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It also considered that the cited provision was incomprehensible since, if understood as provided in that Act, it merely repeated paragraph 1 of section 35 of the OSCOCA, which would be obsolete. Instead it should be interpreted in line with the previous abrogated version of the OSCOCA, which in its section 28(3) had provided for a possibility of extension of the overall maximum period of detention for a further six months, which was in the applicant\u2019s case until 19 November 2013.",
                "17.  On 18 June 2013 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) reiterating his previous arguments.",
                "18.  On 11 July 2013 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s constitutional complaint as unfounded, endorsing the reasoning of the Supreme Court.",
                "19.  The applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention was extended, under Article 123 \u00a7 1 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (risk of reoffending), until the maximum period expired on 19 November 2013, when he was released."

On the same day the Nasimi District Court, relying on the charges brought against the applicant and an application from the prosecutor to apply the preventive measure of remanding the applicant in custody, ordered his detention pending trial for a period of two months. The court justified the application of the preventive custodial measure by the gravity of the offences imputed to him, the risk of his reoffending and the likelihood that he might abscond if released.",

On 12 January 2011 the applicant appealed against that decision, stating that there was no justification for the application of the preventive measure of remand in custody and that the court had failed to substantiate the necessity for his detention pending trial.

                "5.  According to the first applicant, on 8 August 2003, at approximately 11.30 p.m., a police patrol car approached his car on a dark village road. A police officer, using a loudspeaker, ordered the first applicant to pull over. The first applicant replied that he would stop at the nearest road police post. The officer repeated his order, noting that he needed to borrow gasoline for the police car. The first applicant kept driving. Near Svetlograd the police officers blocked the road. When the first applicant stopped the car, one of the five policemen pulled him out of the car and hit him in the face. The police officers threw him against the hood of his car, kicked him in the shins and hit him with a butt of a machine gun. The first applicant fell down and fainted. After he regained consciousness and stood up, the police officers claimed that he was drunk and told him to take a breath test which showed that the first applicant was sober. The police officers checked his documents, searched his car and left. The first applicant got into his car and drove away in the same direction. Having driven approximately 500 metres, he saw that the police car had stopped and that the police officers had gathered around it. The first applicant approached the officers. The officer in charge identified himself as Ye. and apologised for the excessive force his subordinates had used towards the first applicant.",
                "6.  The first applicant arrived home at approximately 2.30 a.m. on 9 August 2003. On the same day the first and third applicants filed a complaint about the incident with the local police station.",

According to the second applicant, her husband told her about the altercation with the police. He also had visible bruising on his face. At 10.30 a.m. the first applicant underwent a medical examination at the same hospital. Having been diagnosed with multiple injuries, he was admitted for in-patient treatment. An extract from a medical record drawn up in the hospital indicated that the first applicant had injuries on the right cheek, the left shin and the lower back and the swelling of soft tissues.",

On 13 August 2003 the first applicant was admitted to the Stavropol Regional Hospital where he was diagnosed with \u201ca multisystem trauma; closed craniocerebral injury; a light brain contusion; an injury of the soft tissues of the right temporal region; a closed uncomplicated stable vertebra medullispinal injury, a compression fracture of the Th. VII vertebra; an intramuscular haematoma of the right side of the lumbar region; a neurologic form of the lumbar plexitis.\u201d Ten days later he was released from hospital on conditions of bed rest and subsequent supervision by a neurologist and orthopaedist.",

They claimed that they had ordered the first applicant to pull over because they had suspected that he had been driving under the influence of alcohol. The first applicant had refused to comply and had verbally insulted them demonstrating obscene hand gestures. After having searched the first applicant and his car, they had let him go.",
                "10.  On the same date the investigator ordered a forensic medical examination of the first applicant. Having examined the first applicant, the forensic expert documented multiple injuries on the right cheek and the lumbar region, multiple bruises all over the body and swelling of the soft tissues. The expert considered that those injuries could have resulted from the impact of solid blunt objects or from the fall.",

According to the first applicant, on 20 September 2003 an investigator of the district prosecutor\u2019s office refused to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers. On 3 October 2003 the district prosecutor dismissed the first applicant\u2019s complaint against the investigator\u2019s decision. Ten days later, the Petrovskiy District Court of the Stavropol Region quashed the prosecutor\u2019s decision and authorised a new round of inquiry.",
                "14.  On 28 October 2003 the police issued a report on the inquiry conducted in response to the first applicant\u2019s complaint. Having examined the forensic medical documents and the statements made by the police officers, the first applicant and the witnesses, the police investigator concluded that the first applicant might have sustained injuries as a result of the force used by the police officers in response to his unlawful actions.",

At the same time the prosecutor endorsed the investigator\u2019s reasoning that there was no evidence showing that the offence had been committed by the police officers. A week later the proceedings were again stayed because the perpetrator of the offence remained unknown.",
                "22.  On 6 June 2006 investigator D. again discontinued the criminal investigation. The investigator established that, when searching the first applicant and his car, one of the police officers had punched him on the right cheek and hit him in the back twice with a blunt solid object. The investigator also accepted that, as of the morning of 9 August 2003, the first applicant had bruises on the right cheek, the back and the left shin. He further noted that the forensic medical experts had not ruled out a possibility that the first applicant might have sustained those injuries as a result of the altercation with the police, as alleged by him. The investigator dismissed the first applicant\u2019s allegations referring to his prior criminal record. He also noted that a number of the first applicant\u2019s neighbours had not confirmed that the latter had had any injuries on him on 9 August 2003. As regards the statements made to the contrary by the other neighbours, the investigator found them to be unsubstantiated. Lastly, the investigator took into account that all the police officers denied the first applicant\u2019s accusations. However, it was impossible for the investigator to establish the alleged perpetrator for lack of relevant evidence.",
                "23.  It appears that the decision of 6 June 2006 was quashed and the case was re-opened.",
                "24.  On 17 July 2006 investigator D. discontinued the criminal investigation reproducing verbatim his earlier decision of 6 June 2006. He also considered that the first applicant had willfully made false accusations against the police officers and should be held liable for his actions. The investigator forwarded the relevant material to the prosecutor\u2019s office.",
                "25.  On 14 January 2011 the deputy head of the supervision unit of the Investigative committee considered the decision of 17 July 2006 unlawful and unsubstantiated, quashed it and remitted the matter for further investigation. He noted, inter alia, that the investigator had failed (1) to establish what each of the police officers had done once they had pulled over the first applicant\u2019s car; (2) to check whether any of the police officers had had a machine gun as claimed by the first applicant; and (3) to establish the reasons why the witnesses who had initially claimed that they had seen the police officers beating the first applicant had revoked their statements.",

On 1 March 2011 the senior investigator with the district investigative committee dismissed the first applicant\u2019s accusations against the police officers duplicating the findings summed up in the earlier decisions on the matter. Nevertheless, he allowed that the first applicant\u2019s injuries could have resulted from the beatings and that a criminal investigation should be opened on charges of battery. He transmitted the materials to the head of the district investigative committee. The parties did not inform about the outcome of the proceedings.",
                "27.  On 30 September 2004, at approximately 11.00 p.m., the applicants, suspecting that their neighbour had committed a number of thefts and intended to steal their property, beat him up, broke into his car, took the documents for the car and refused to return them until the arrival of a police patrol car.",
                "28.  On 15 June 2005 the Petrovskiy District Court found the applicants guilty of vigilantism and sentenced each of them to two and half years\u2019 imprisonment.

On 4 February 2011 the applicants\u2019 consent to the application of the settlement procedure was recorded in a report signed by the prosecutor and the applicants\u2019 representatives. The report stated that the applicants had been informed of their rights under the settlement procedure and set out the consequences of applying the settlement procedure. In a section entitled \u201cRemarks\u201d, it was noted that the applicants had given up their claims in respect of non-pecuniary damage against J. (as lodged on 9 and 10 December 2010), but had not given up their claim for reimbursement of the legal costs incurred in the criminal proceedings. The report also stated that the victims had no right to withdraw their consent to the settlement procedure. At that time, the applicants had submitted neither an itemised list of legal costs nor any supporting documents.",

According to the court record, the trial judge disclosed the applicants\u2019 claim for reimbursement of their legal costs. J. asked the court not to examine the claim as it had been absorbed by the out-of-court settlement agreement. The applicants alleged that they had not been allowed to address the court notwithstanding their presence in the court building.",
                "15.  In a judgment of the same date, the Harju County Court convicted J. of violating traffic and driving regulations and sentenced him to a suspended prison term. It also withdrew J.\u2019s driving licence and ordered him to pay the State Treasury expenses consisting of compensation levies (sundraha) and the cost of expert assessments. It held that the victims had given up the civil claims they had lodged within the framework of the criminal proceedings. The judgment made no reference to the applicants\u2019 claim for reimbursement of the legal costs incurred in the criminal proceedings.",
                "16.  The applicants lodged an appeal against that judgment. They complained that they had not been allowed to attend the court hearing of 7 March 2011 and that the court had left their claim for reimbursement of the legal costs undecided.",
                "17.  On 23 March 2011 the Harju County Court refused to examine the appeal. Relying on Articles 246 and 318 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CCrP; Kriminaalmenetluse seadustik), the court found that the applicants had not been parties to the court proceedings and did not, therefore, have the right to appeal (see paragraph 29 below).",
                "18.  The applicants appealed against the County Court\u2019s decision, insisting that they had been parties to the proceedings and had the right to appeal.",
                "19.  At a public hearing on 5 April 2011 the Tallinn Court of Appeal examined the appeal in the presence of J. and his counsel, the prosecutor and the applicants\u2019 counsel. At the hearing, the prosecutor firstly noted that the applicants had not submitted any documents concerning their claim for legal costs, despite the fact that they had had a week after the settlement to do so. According to the report of the hearing, the prosecutor later noted that those documents could have been submitted when the applicants had signed the report (see paragraph 10 above) or a few days later. The report stated that J. had wanted to submit the out-of-court settlement agreement to the judge in order to prove that it covered all the relevant damages. However, the Court of Appeal had refused, considering that it did not concern the subject matter of the dispute before the court in those proceedings.",
                "20.  By a decision of 13 April 2011, the Tallinn Court of Appeal dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal and upheld the Harju County Court\u2019s decision of 23 March 2011. It referred to Article 243 of the CCrP, under which the victim was not entitled to revoke his or her consent to the application of the settlement procedure, and to Article 246 of the Code, which provided that the victim did not have to be summoned to a court hearing in settlement proceedings (see paragraphs 28 and 29 below). The Court of Appeal concluded that the applicants, as victims, had not been parties to such court proceedings and that, accordingly, they had no right to appeal against the County Court\u2019s judgment.",
                "21.  Although the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision stated that it was final and not amenable to appeal, the applicants\u2019 counsel nevertheless challenged it before the Supreme Court.",
                "22.  By a decision of 3 October 2011 in case no. 3-1-1-60-11 the Supreme Court refused to examine the appeal on points of law because the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision had been final and not amenable to appeal. It nevertheless stated that according to the established case-law, in settlement proceedings the court should not limit itself to merely analysing the settlement reached. It must also verify whether there were still questions that should be addressed in the subsequent judgment, but which had not been included in the settlement agreement. The court noted that according to Article 245 of the CCrP, the settlement agreement did not necessarily have to address matters dealing with the costs of criminal procedure or cover the extent of granting the civil claim or of compensating for the damage caused by the criminal offence. However, referring to Article 306 \u00a7\u00a7 11, 13 and 14 of the CCrP and Article 248 \u00a7 1 (3) of the CCrP, the Supreme Court considered that those matters should not be overlooked by the court concerned (see paragraphs 30 and 31 below)."

                "6.  On 9 December 2007 both applicants went to a football match in Munich.",
                "7.  The police had predicted an increased risk of clashes between rival football supporters owing to confrontations at previous matches between the two teams. Therefore a total of 227 police officers were deployed, including two squads \u2013 comprising eight to ten police officers each \u2013 of the 3rd platoon of the Munich riot control unit (Unterst\u00fctzungskommando), one squad of the 2nd platoon of the Munich riot control unit and the 23rd platoon of the 6th Dachau public-order support force battalion (Bereitschaftspolizei). The deployed officers of the Munich riot control unit also included \u201cvideo officers\u201d, who carried handheld video cameras and recorded videos of incidents that might be relevant under criminal law. The officers of the Munich riot control unit were dressed in black/dark blue uniforms and wore black helmets with visors. The officers of the Dachau public-order support force battalion wore green uniforms and white helmets with visors. Both uniforms did not include any name tags or other signs identifying the individual officers. However, on the back of the helmets an identification number of the squad was displayed.",
                "8.  After the match had ended the police cordoned off the stands of the supporters of one of the teams, including both applicants, to prevent them from leaving the stadium and encountering supporters of the other team. The cordon was lifted after around fifteen minutes.",
                "9.  According to the first applicant, he left the stands after the blockade had been lifted. While walking between the exit of the stands and the exit of the football stadium a group of police officers dressed in black uniforms came running towards the exiting spectators with their truncheons raised above their heads. Some of these officers started hitting the spectators with their truncheons without any prior warning as soon as they reached them. The first applicant himself was hit with a truncheon on the head, which resulted in a bleeding laceration of 3 cm behind his ear. After having reached the exit of the stadium he was treated by a paramedic in an ambulance that was parked close to the ground. Subsequently, he returned to his home town, where he was treated in the emergency unit of the local hospital.",
                "10.  The second applicant also exited the stands after the blockade had been lifted. Before exiting the stadium he was grabbed by the shoulder and, after turning round, had pepper spray doused in the face at close range. He lay down on the ground and was subsequently struck on his left upper arm with a truncheon. He suffered swelling and redness of his face and pain in his arm.",
                "11.  Both applicants were able to identify their attackers as police officers, but were not able to distinguish them further, owing to their identical uniforms and the lack of identifying signs or name tags.",
                "12.  According to the Government the blockade was lifted due to the aggressive behaviour of some of the spectators and the pressure applied to the police cordon. When the supporters streamed from the stands towards the exit, they came upon police units which had been called in to provide backup for the police cordon. Subsequently some of the supporters continued their aggressive behaviour towards these officers and provoked them. The supporters\u2019 conduct resulted in the arrest of one supporter and two police officers sustained minor injuries. After a few minutes the police pacified the situation and got the exiting supporters under control.",
                "13.  The Government furthermore challenged the accounts of the applicants and submitted that there was no credible evidence that the applicants had deliberately been hit or harmed by police officers and that the injuries had been a result of the police operation.",
                "14.  As of 15 December 2007 the press reported about the police operation in the aftermath of the football match, inter alia quoting football supporters describing arbitrary attacks by police officers of the riot control unit with truncheons and pepper-spray. In an article of 18 December 2007 a spokesperson of the police commented on the operation and stated that the alleged assaults by police officers would be investigated. On 2 January 2008, the Munich public prosecutor\u2019s office instigated a preliminary investigation. On 21 January 2008 the second applicant reported the alleged police violence and submitted a medical certificate concerning the effects of the pepper spray on his face from the same day. He filed a formal criminal complaint on 7 March 2008. The first applicant filed a criminal complaint against an unidentified police officer on 25 April 2008. He also submitted a medical certificate confirming a bleeding laceration on his head. The certificate was issued at 12.05 a.m. on 10 December 2007. Several other spectators at the match had also lodged criminal complaints against unidentified police officers.",
                "15.  The investigation was conducted by the unit of the Munich police responsible for offences perpetrated by public officials under the responsibility of the Munich public prosecutor\u2019s office. The officer in charge interviewed a total of twenty witnesses, including the applicants, the officer in charge of the Munich riot control unit and the squad leaders of the deployed squads of the 2nd and 3rd Munich riot control units.",
                "16.  The investigating division was also provided with a DVD showing excerpts of the video surveillance recorded by the riot control police at the football match. The DVDs were compiled by the \u201cvideo officers\u201d of the Munich riot control unit. In line with their usual procedure the entire recorded video material was reviewed by the respective video officer after his or her deployment and the parts which were deemed relevant under criminal law and of sufficient quality to serve as evidence were copied to a DVD.",
                "17.  On 10 September 2008 the competent public prosecutor discontinued the investigation. He found that the investigation had produced evidence that some of the police officers had used truncheons against spectators, including women and children, in a disproportionate way and without an official order or approval. However, he concluded that the investigation had not led to a situation where concrete acts of violence could be related to specific police officers and it could not be ascertained either whether the use of force had been justified. In sum, the public prosecutor had been able neither to establish whether the applicants\u2019 injuries had been inflicted by police officers nor to identify the suspects who had allegedly struck and used pepper spray on the applicants.",
                "18.  The applicants appealed against the decision to discontinue the investigation and argued, in particular, that the public prosecutor had only questioned the squad leaders, but had not identified all the officers involved in the operation and deployed in the area of the stadium at issue.",
                "19.  On 14 October 2008 the public prosecutor reopened the investigation and ordered further enquiries. On 20 October 2008 the head of the investigation unit met with the platoon leaders of the Munich riot control unit and other division heads of the Munich police to discuss the investigation. Neither the public prosecutor nor the applicants\u2019 representative attended the internal police meeting. Subsequently, a further twenty-two witnesses were interviewed including fourteen platoon leaders, squad leaders and video officers of the deployed police units. The individual squad members of the three squads of the Munich riot control unit were not interviewed. The applicants had requested that they be interviewed, as the evidence had suggested that the alleged perpetrators had belonged to one of these three squads.",
                "20.  The investigating police unit was also provided with video surveillance recorded by the 23rd platoon of the 6th Dachau public-order support force battalion. Upon the request of the applicants to secure the entire video material of the police operation, and not only the already submitted video excerpts, it was established that the original video tapes and possible digital copies had already been deleted and that only the excerpts were still available.",
                "21.  On 4 August 2009 the public prosecutor discontinued the investigation again. In a detailed fifteen-page decision he first summarised the investigative measures taken, referring in particular to the interviews of several witnesses, including police officers and the alleged victims, the review of video material from the police and from the internet, the assessment of the applicants\u2019 written observations and of the submitted documents, inter alia, medical certificates, as well as gathered information and reports on past events and applicable guidelines. After assessing all the available evidence, the public prosecutor concluded that the enquiries had shown that several supporters had aggressively approached, insulted and provoked the deployed police officers and that therefore a situation had existed in which the officers could have been justified in using their truncheons. Besides this general conclusion he held that the applicants had neither been able to identify a particular suspect nor to determine whether the suspected police officers had been male or female and that the investigation had not produced other persons who had witnessed the alleged acts against the applicants. Furthermore, he outlined in detail certain \u201cconsiderable discrepancies\u201d in the witness statements of the first applicant and referred to \u201cunspecific\u201d statements of the second applicant. Consequently, according to the public prosecutor, there was insufficient evidence to establish criminal conduct by specific police officers to the detriment of both applicants. He concluded that the investigation had to be discontinued again, since the considerable additional investigative measures had not revealed disproportionate conduct on the part of individual police officers, in particular truncheon strikes against innocent bystanders, which would require criminal prosecution of the respective officers.",
                "22.  On 20 August 2009 the applicants appealed and pointed out that the members of the deployed squads had still not been questioned and that the inspected videos were fragmentary, but nonetheless contradicted certain parts of the statements made by the squad leaders.",
                "23.  On 3 February 2011 the Munich general public prosecutor confirmed the decision of the public prosecutor\u2019s office of 4 August 2009 to discontinue the investigation. The instructions on available legal remedies attached to the decision informed the applicants that they could request a judicial decision in the framework of proceedings to force criminal proceedings (Klageerzwingungsverfahren).",
                "24.  On 19 September 2011 the Munich Court of Appeal declared the applicants\u2019 application to force further enquiries inadmissible. The court interpreted the applicants\u2019 request as an application to force criminal proceedings (Klageerzwingungsantrag) and held that these proceedings were only admissible if the prosecution of one or more identified accused had been requested. An application to force criminal proceedings against an unidentified accused had to be declared inadmissible, since the proceedings were not supposed to identify the accused or replace investigations. Only in a case where a public prosecutor\u2019s office had entirely refrained from investigating a crime had a court the possibility to order an investigation. Under Article 173 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Strafprozessordnung \u2013 hereinafter \u201cthe CCP\u201d; see paragraph 37 below) a court was only allowed to conduct minor enquiries to fill in remaining gaps in an investigation. Moreover, the applicants had not submitted specific facts or evidence that would have allowed the court to identify an accused.",
                "25.  On 25 October 2011 the applicants lodged a constitutional complaint, relying on Articles 2 \u00a7 2, 19 \u00a7 4 and 103 \u00a7 1 of the German Basic Law (Grundgesetz) (see paragraphs 29-31 below). Besides referring to articles of the Basic Law, the applicants also referred in their complaint to Articles 2, 3, and 13 of the Convention. In essence they complained that the investigation had not been effective and that the Court of Appeal had not evaluated the effectiveness of the investigation.",
                "26.  On 23 March 2015 the Federal Constitutional Court (hereinafter \u201cthe Constitutional Court\u201d) refused, in a reasoned decision (2 BvR 1304/12), to admit the applicants\u2019 constitutional complaint. The court held that the investigations had been conducted diligently, but had not established sufficient suspicion of criminal conduct on the part of specific police officers. Moreover, the remaining gaps and factual uncertainties could not be attributed to omissions in the investigation. The court also found that it had not been necessary to question all the squad members who had possibly been involved. In its decision the Constitutional Court referred to the Court\u2019s case-law concerning the procedural obligation of Article 2 of the Convention and, in particular, to the cases of McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom (27 September 1995, Series A no. 324) and Grams v. Germany ((dec.), no. 33677/96, ECHR 1999\u2011VII). The court also emphasised that the public prosecutor\u2019s office had been the responsible authority for the investigation and thereby \u201cmaster of the proceedings\u201d (Herr des Verfahrens).",
                "27.  During the investigation the applicants also filed criminal complaints in respect of assistance given in an official capacity in avoiding prosecution or punishment (Strafvereitelung im Amt) and suppression of evidence (Beweismittelunterdr\u00fcckung). The applicants alleged that several relevant parts of the video material, showing disproportionate police violence, had been deleted. The investigation against the five police officers was discontinued by the Munich public prosecutor\u2019s office.",
                "28.  A subsequent appeal before the Munich general public prosecutor was to no avail."

The next day civil proceedings were instituted in that connection. The applicant disagreed; she argued that she did not owe any money to the plaintiff \u2013 they had not concluded an agreement for maintenance services and she was free to choose another service provider.

                "14.  On 14 February 2008 the applicant\u2019s representative pleaded the case. He argued that the service charges which the applicant had been asked to settle had been unclear. The plaintiff did not have all the relevant documents at hand and thus requested time to submit additional information. The City Court ordered the plaintiff to submit the specific documents and scheduled the next hearing for 17 April 2008.",

                "16.  The parties continued to plead their case in the hearing of 4 June 2008. The City Court imposed a monetary fine on the applicant\u2019s representative for disobeying a judge\u2019s order. Following an application by the plaintiff the hearing was postponed because the applicant\u2019s debt for services had in the meantime increased; they had not prepared the documents for the increased amount of the debt. The plaintiff was ordered to submit the relevant documents by an unknown date in September 2008 and the next hearing was scheduled for 28 October 2008.",

On 27 November 2008 the plaintiff appealed against the judgment. On 28 November 2008 a judge of the City Court gave the plaintiff additional time to comply with the procedural requirements for lodging an appeal. On 2 December 2008 the plaintiff rectified those deficiencies. On 3 December 2008 the appeal was admitted and sent to the Riga Regional Court (R\u012bgas apgabaltiesa \u2013 hereinafter \u201cthe Regional Court\u201d).",
                "18.  The first hearing before the Regional Court was held on 13 September 2010. The plaintiff increased the amount of the claim because the applicant\u2019s debt for services had in the meantime increased to LVL 3,173 (approximately EUR 4,515) and submitted the relevant documents. The applicant\u2019s representative disagreed with the increase of the claim. The Regional Court admitted those documents to the case file and scheduled the next hearing for 8 December 2010.",
                "19.  On 8 December 2010 the Regional Court held the last hearing in the case. The plaintiff did not attend, nor did it inform the court of any reasons for its absence. The Regional Court decided to proceed with the case. On 22 December 2010 the Riga Regional Court partly allowed the plaintiff\u2019s claim and ordered the applicant to settle the debt in the total amount of LVL 2,854 (approximately EUR 4,059). Although the parties had not concluded an agreement for maintenance services, the applicant was obliged to pay for those services in accordance with domestic law. She could contest bills provided by the plaintiff, however she had failed to do so. The applicant had selectively paid some bills, but not all of them. The Regional Court refused the plaintiff\u2019s claim to receive contractual penalty (l\u012bgumsods) for late payment but awarded default interest of 6%. On 18 January 2011 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law. On 3 February 2012 the Senate of the Supreme Court (Augst\u0101k\u0101s tiesas Sen\u0101ts) remitted it to the Regional Court as the applicant had not paid the security deposit for lodging it.

                "5.  On 17 August 1999 the applicant\u2019s daughter, Nesrin Deliba\u015f, lost her life following the collapse of the building where she resided in D\u00fczce as the result of an earthquake (see M. \u00d6zel and Others v. Turkey, nos. 14350/05 and 2 others, \u00a7 16, 17 November 2015 for further details regarding that earthquake). According to official records, fourteen other people lost their lives as a result of the collapse of the same building.",
                "6.  Shortly after the incident, criminal proceedings were brought against the contractor (H.E.) and the architect (S.D.) of the building in question. On 27 August and 31 August 1999 H.E. and S.D. were questioned by the police and the D\u00fczce public prosecutor, respectively. They denied all accusations in respect of the collapse of the building.",
                "7.  During an expert examination of the remains of the building on 26 August 1999, certain problems were noted with the building\u2019s reinforcing rods. It was also noted that the metal brackets had not been properly fastened to the girders. Apart from H.E. and S.D., against whom charges had already been brought in connection with the collapse of the building, the experts also identified the involvement of T.A., a civil engineer, and \u0130.\u00d6., the Head of Technical Services of the Municipality of D\u00fczce (\u201cthe Municipality\u201d), in the preparation and authorisation of the respective construction project.",
                "8.  On 31 August 1999 the police questioned \u0130.\u00d6., the Head of Technical Services of the Municipality. He denied all accusations in respect of the collapse of the building.",
                "9.  According to another report dated 7 September 1999, the expert examination of the collapsed building revealed that the granulometry of the concrete used in the building was very poor, that the concrete contained a very high proportion of pebbles, that the water-to-cement ratio in the concrete mix was not appropriate and had resulted in the formation of pores in the concrete, and that the ironwork had worked loose from the concrete because the metal brackets had corroded.",
                "10.  On 14 September 1999 the applicant asked to join the proceedings as a civil party. He added that he wished to lodge a criminal complaint against all individuals who had been involved in the construction of the defective building in their different capacities, including the public officials who had authorised its construction and occupation.",
                "11.  On 23 September 1999 the D\u00fczce public prosecutor disjoined the investigation against the Head of Technical Services of the Municipality (\u0130.\u00d6.) from those against H.E. and S.D. in view of the special judicial procedures that had to be followed in respect of the prosecution of civil servants under the Law on the Prosecution of Civil Servants and Public Officials (Law no. 4483).",
                "12.  On 24 September 1999 the D\u00fczce public prosecutor\u2019s office filed a bill of indictment with the D\u00fczce Assize Court against H.E. and S.D. in respect of the deaths caused by the collapse of the building in question on 17 August 1999. The public prosecutor accused them of endangering the lives of others by carelessness, negligence or inexperience under Article 383 \u00a7 2 of the Turkish Criminal Code in force at the material time (Law no. 765), emphasising in particular the structural shortcomings in the building noted by the experts (see paragraph 7 and 9 above).",
                "13.  At the hearing held on 21 October 1999 the applicant requested the investigation of all municipal officials who had authorised the construction and occupation of the building despite its failure to comply with the relevant technical regulations. Over the course of the criminal proceedings, the applicant repeated this request at least ten times.",
                "14.  According to an expert report added to the criminal case file on 29 April 2001, the following people had responsibility for all private construction undertaken within the municipal boundaries: (i) the contractor, who was responsible for the realisation of the project in compliance with the technical and work safety standards; (ii) the project engineer, who was responsible for all technical aspects of the project, including compliance with all relevant rules and regulations; (iii) the municipal representative, who was responsible for examining the calculations and the plan prepared by the project manager, verifying the compatibility of the project with the regulations in force, and authorising the project; and (iv) the technical implementation officer, who was in charge of inspecting the construction work on behalf of the Municipality. On this basis, the experts concluded that H.E. and S.D. bore 25% and 37.5% responsibility for the collapse of the building. The experts stated that they could not, however, offer opinions on the responsibility of anyone other than the two defendants in the case (H.E. and S.D.).",
                "15.  On 21 June 2001 the D\u00fczce Assize Court held that the statutory period during which H.E. and S.D. could be held criminally liable in connection with a collapse of the building had started running in 1985 \u2013 when the last official licence for the building was obtained \u2013 and had already expired by the date of the earthquake. The case was accordingly discontinued for having become time\u2011barred. The applicant appealed.",
                "16.  On 21 October 2002 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first-instance court. It held that the statutory time-limit was to be calculated from the date on which the building collapsed, that is to say from 17 August 1999, the date on which the offence in question had been committed.",
                "17.  On 14 August 2003 an additional indictment was filed against T.A., the civil engineer who had taken part in the construction of the building in question (see paragraph 7 above). It was noted in the indictment that T.A. had obtained licences to secure the illegal extension of the building subsequent to its construction.",
                "18.  On 11 December 2003 the D\u00fczce Assize Court convicted H.E., S.D. and T.A. as charged and sentenced each of them to 10 months\u2019 imprisonment and a fine, but decided to suspend execution of the sentences under Section 6 of the Execution of Sentences Act (Law no. 647). The applicant appealed against this judgment and once again requested an investigation into the responsibility of the relevant municipal officials in relation to the collapse of the building.",
                "19.  On 6 July 2004 the Court of Cassation once again quashed the first\u2011instance court\u2019s judgment, this time as the court had not taken any decision as regards the applicant\u2019s request to join the proceedings as a civil party in respect of the case subsequently brought against T.A.",
                "20.  On 5 October 2004 the D\u00fczce Assize Court commissioned a new expert report from the Y\u0131ld\u0131z Technical University in Istanbul. The expert report subsequently released on 21 April 2005 found that the building in question had collapsed on account of the structural problems noted in the earlier expert reports, as well as its illegal extension subsequent to its construction. It was also stated in the report that the defendants jointly bore 75% of the responsibility for the collapse of the building. The remaining 25% responsibility lay with the Municipality officials on account of their failure to duly inspect the building before issuing it with the necessary permits for occupation.",
                "21.  On 7 June 2005 the D\u00fczce Assize Court convicted H.E., S.D. and T.A. as charged, and sentenced each of them, once again, to 10 months\u2019 imprisonment and a fine. Execution of the sentences was suspended pursuant to Article 51 \u00a7 1 of the new Criminal Code (Law no. 5237). Relying on the findings of the later expert report as regards the responsibility of the municipal officials for the collapse of the building, it also decided that a criminal complaint should be filed against the relevant officials with the D\u00fczce public prosecutor\u2019s office. The defendant H.E lodged an appeal against this judgment.",
                "22.  On 5 December 2005 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment for the third time. It found that the assize court had failed to evaluate the case in the light of the new Criminal Code (Law no. 5237) which had entered into force on 1 June 2005.",
                "23.  On 21 February 2007 the D\u00fczce Assize Court decided to discontinue the criminal proceedings in respect of all three of the defendants as the prosecution of the offence in question had become time-barred.",
                "24.  On 23 October 2007 the Court of Cassation held firstly that the decision of the first-instance court, in so far as it concerned S.E. and T.A., was null and void, since the earlier judgment of 7 June 2005 had already become final in their regard as they had not lodged an appeal. It then went on to uphold the decision to discontinue the proceedings in respect of H.E. only.",
                "25.  On 16 August 2000 the applicant, along with his wife and other daughter, instituted compensation proceedings before the Sakarya Administrative Court against the the Ministry of Public Works and Settlement (Bay\u0131nd\u0131rl\u0131k ve \u0130skan Bakanl\u0131\u011f\u0131), the D\u00fczce governor\u2019s office and the Municipality of D\u00fczce, in respect of the death of their daughter Nesrin Deliba\u015f. The applicant and his wife each claimed 2,000 Turkish liras (TRY) in respect of pecuniary damage and TRY 1,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage. Their daughter claimed TRY 500 in respect of non-pecuniary damage only.",
                "26.  On 29 December 2005 the Sakarya Administrative Court commissioned an expert report to determine responsibility on the part of the administration for the collapse of the building.",
                "27.  As regards the findings in the reports adduced to the criminal case file, the experts noted that the quality of the concrete used in the construction and certain structural elements of the building had been below the required standard. The building had, moreover, been illegally extended after its construction. The municipal officials had failed to duly inspect the building during its construction phase or before issuing the necessary permit for its occupation. They had also failed to carry out a soil survey in the area and to identify the potential \u201cdisaster zones\u201d in the event of an earthquake, with a view to limiting the height of buildings in such areas. The experts concluded that, in view of such failures, the Municipality had been 50% responsible for the collapse of the building in question. On the other hand, it found that the other two defendants had not been at fault.",
                "28.  Relying on that expert report, on 27 June 2007 the Sakarya Administrative Court partially accepted the applicant\u2019s claims against the Municipality, and awarded him TRY 1,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage in accordance with his request, plus interest. It also awarded his wife and daughter TRY 1,000 and TRY 500, respectively, in respect of non\u2011pecuniary damage. It rejected their claims in respect of pecuniary damage as being unfounded.",
                "29.  On 14 September 2007 the applicant and his family received a total of TRY 11,371.80 (approximately 6,455 euros (EUR) at the material time) from the Municipality as compensation. In the meantime, the Municipality appealed against the judgment of the Sakarya Administrative Court.",

                "6.  The applicant had a daughter, K.M., who was born on 19 November 1985.",
                "7.  On 7 September 2007 at 10 p.m. K.M., who was in the early weeks of pregnancy at the time, was at home with her parents and husband when she fainted and began to have convulsions. An ambulance was called, which arrived 40-45 minutes later.",
                "8.  Upon arrival, the ambulance doctor, A.G., found K.M. nearly unconscious, with impaired breathing and low blood pressure. According to the applicant, the doctor was told at that point that K.M. was pregnant. A.G. diagnosed a convulsion syndrome, gave K.M. two injections \u2013 one of relanium and one of magnesium \u2013 and took her to hospital. It appears that neither the doctor nor the nurse nor the driver of the ambulance helped her family carry K.M. downstairs from the eighth floor of the building and put her into the ambulance. Moreover, although K.M. had not regained consciousness after the injections, A.G. chose not to sit beside her during the journey to hospital, but instead sat beside the driver in the driver\u2019s cab.",
                "9.  On the same day A.G. and the nurse drew up an ambulance visit record stating that they had arrived seven minutes after receiving the ambulance call and that they had administered only one medical injection, of relanium.",
                "10.  On 14 September 2007 K.M. died in hospital without ever regaining consciousness.",
                "11.  On the same day the Avan and Nor-Nork District Prosecutor\u2019s Office of Yerevan launched an inquiry into her death and ordered an autopsy, which was also carried out that day. According to its report (forensic medical opinion no. 728), K.M. died from general intoxication of the organism, caused by an impairment of vital brain function, which in turn had been caused by extensive and diffuse thrombosis of neuro-vessels.",
                "12.  During the inquiry, the investigator took statements from the medical personnel who had provided assistance to K.M., including A.G., the nurse, and the driver. In particular, in her statement of 14 November 2007 the nurse stated that the doctor had ordered her to administer an injection of magnesium sulphate but that K.M.\u2019s convulsions had continued, after which the doctor had handed her a phial of relanium, which she had injected. In her statement made on the same day A.G. explained that upon arrival they had found K.M. having seizures and that, from talking to her family, she had learnt that K.M. was pregnant. She had then ordered the nurse to inject relanium and, knowing that K.M. was pregnant, she did not inject any other medication and did not take any further measures since she did not consider it necessary in the circumstances.",
                "13.  On 26 November 2007 the ambulance nurse and A.G. were questioned again. The nurse stated, in particular, that the fact that only the injection of relanium and not the one of magnesium had been mentioned in the ambulance visit record could possibly be explained by her having forgotten to remind the doctor about the injection of magnesium. A.G. stated, inter alia, that she had ordered the nurse to give two injections.",
                "14.  In the course of the inquiry the investigator ordered a forensic medical investigation to be carried out by a panel of experts. According to the results of the opinion (forensic medical opinion no. 89) produced on 14 January 2008, the injection of relanium 2 mg and magnesium 3 g by the ambulance crew had been correct at the given moment, taking into account the patient\u2019s condition \u2212 that is to say convulsion syndrome \u2212 and the injection of the given quantity of those substances was not contra-indicated. The opinion also stated that K.M.\u2019s medical treatment had been correct and had corresponded to the diagnosis.",
                "15.  On 27 February 2008 the investigator decided to reject the institution of criminal proceedings for lack of corpus delicti.",
                "16.  On 29 February 2008 the applicant lodged an application with the Avan and Nor-Nork District Prosecutor\u2019s Office of Yerevan, seeking a new forensic medical investigation in which he would be allowed to participate. In particular, he claimed that his daughter had died as a result of negligence by A.G., who had given her two injections of chemical substances, the use of which was contra\u2011indicated given K.M.\u2019s pregnancy, impaired breathing and low blood pressure. In this respect, the applicant referred to medical instructions on the use of relanium and magnesium and extracts from a medical book, copies of which he attached to his application. The applicant also alleged that the ambulance had arrived belatedly, had lacked essential medical equipment such as an oxygen cylinder, and that the ambulance crew in general had not acted with due diligence.",
                "17.  On 3 March 2008 the District Prosecutor\u2019s Office decided to quash the decision of 27 February 2008 and remit the case to the investigator for further inquiry. The decision stated, in particular, that the applicant\u2019s request for an additional forensic medical investigation involving his participation was well-founded.",
                "18.  On 5 March 2008 the investigator ordered an additional forensic medical investigation by a panel of experts which was asked to determine the following:\n\u201c1.  The cause of K.M.\u2019s death, whether she suffered from any illnesses from birth ... whether an illness she had suffered from birth could have caused her death or somehow have a causal link to her death. 2.  Whether the injection of relanium 2 mg and magnesium 3 g by the ambulance crew was correct, whether the quantity was within that allowed and whether injecting magnesium might have entailed negative consequences. 3.  Whether there was any medication (in medical theory, in science) or medical approach the administration of which could have improved K.M.\u2019s condition and whether it should have been administered by the ambulance crew or in hospital. Whether the medical treatment had been appropriate and sufficient or whether omissions had occurred and, if so, who had been responsible for them. 4.  K.M.\u2019s transfer to the hospital took about 40 minutes; whether speedier transfer to the hospital would have made it possible to save K.M. 5.  Whether K.M.\u2019s five-week pregnancy contributed to the emergence and development of her illness, whether the pregnancy and the illness she was diagnosed with had a direct causal link with each other. 6.  K.M.\u2019s hospital record ... contained notes concerning the medical assistance, injections and medication and the doctors who had administered them over seven days. Whether the medical treatment provided had been correct, the injected medication correctly chosen with regard to type and quantity and whether these were permissible or not. If not, which doctor was responsible for errors and finally whether the medical treatment administered had brought about death. 7.  The scientific methods on which forensic medical opinion no. 728 and the forensic medical opinion no. 89 of the panel of experts were based, whether these were supported by medical literature and which methods had been applied during previous examinations...",
                "19.  On 23 April 2008 the panel of experts delivered its report (forensic medical opinion no. 6), the conclusions of which read as follows:\n\u201c1  and 8: No information indicating that K.M. had congenital disorders was discovered, according to the medical documents. K.M.\u2019s death resulted from general intoxication of the organism, caused by an impairment of vital brain function, which in turn was caused by extensive and diffuse thrombosis of neuro-vessels. As regards prior diseases resulting in functional disorders which could have brought about the convulsion syndrome, it was impossible to draw any conclusions in the absence of relevant medical documents. 2.  Injection of relanium 2 mg and magnesium 3 g by the emergency care specialists was correct in view of the presence of the convulsion syndrome at the given moment. Not injecting magnesium at the given moment could have entailed negative consequences. 3.  In the case in question the medical assistance provided by the ambulance crew and in hospital was appropriate and sufficient, without omissions, which is substantiated by the data contained in the medical documents and by the evidentiary material in the case file. 5.  K.M.\u2019s five-week pregnancy was not linked to the cause of her death since the pregnancy and the illnesses did not have a direct causal link with each other either. 7.  Opinion no. 728 concerning the forensic medical examination of K.M.\u2019s corpse and opinion no. 89 produced by the forensic medical investigation panel are accurate and well\u2011founded; scientific methodologies were applied: histological examinations of the organs of the corpse were performed, and leading specialists of the Ministry of Health participated in the panel examination.",
                "20.  On 25 April 2008 the investigator decided to reject the institution of criminal proceedings for lack of corpus delicti. The decision stated in particular that the relevant members of the medical personnel, including the emergency care specialists who had provided first aid assistance to K.M., had been questioned. It further reiterated the conclusions of the experts reflected in the forensic medical opinions nos. 89 and 6 and stated that the initial medical assistance administered as first-aid and the subsequent hospital treatment provided to K.M. had been performed properly, appropriately and in a timely manner without any errors or omissions.",
                "21.  On the same day the investigator lodged a request with the director of the \u201cEmergency Medical Service\u201d State Close Joint Stock Company of the Yerevan Municipality (\u201cthe Emergency Medical Service\u201d) seeking to impose an appropriate penalty on the ambulance crew. In particular, the investigator stated that there had been a 40-minute delay before the ambulance arrived and that only one of two injections given to K.M. had been mentioned by the ambulance doctor in the visit record. Furthermore, the process of taking the patient to hospital had been slow and disorganised. The ambulance driver had not carried the patient downstairs and had not assisted in putting her in the ambulance. Instead of sitting beside K.M., whose condition was extremely critical, the doctor had chosen to sit in the driver\u2019s cab next to the driver. The investigator\u2019s conclusion was therefore that the ambulance crew had arrived after a serious delay and had not provided proper medical assistance.",
                "22.  On 30 April 2008 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Avan and Nor-Nork District Court of Yerevan concerning the investigator\u2019s decision of 25 April 2008 seeking the institution of criminal proceedings against A.G. and the nurse. The applicant submitted, in particular, that the panel of experts performing the additional forensic medical investigation had not taken due account of his arguments, which had been based on relevant medical literature and Government decrees. He reiterated his arguments with regard to the contra-indication of relanium and magnesium in cases of pregnancy and low blood pressure and the other arguments previously submitted in his complaint lodged with the District Prosecutor\u2019s Office.",
                "23.  On 16 May 2008 the medical council of the Emergency Medical Service held a meeting at which the circumstances described in the investigator\u2019s decision of 25 April 2008 were discussed. It appears that the members of the ambulance crew submitted written \u201cexplanations\u201d (\u0562\u0561\u0581\u0561\u057f\u0580\u0578\u0582\u0569\u0575\u0578\u0582\u0576) in relation to the events of 7 September 2007. As a result, A.G. received a reprimand for serious breach of work regulations and medical ethics. Also, the head of the relevant emergency department was ordered to improve the supervision of employees as regards respecting work regulations, so as to prevent similar occurrences in future, and to examine every such case.",
                "24.  On 26 May 2008 the Avan and Nor-Nork District Court of Yerevan dismissed the applicant\u2019s complaint, finding that the inquiry into K.M.\u2019s death had been thorough and adequate. In doing so, the District Court referred to the results of the fresh forensic medical opinion. As regards the late arrival of the ambulance, incorrect completion of the visit record and the doctor\u2019s failure to sit beside the patient during the journey to the hospital, the District Court referred to the fact that A.G. had been reprimanded for poor performance of her duties.",
                "25.  On 16 July 2008 the applicant lodged an appeal against this decision with the Criminal Court of Appeal. He argued, in particular, that the District Court had failed to question A.G. and the nurse. Furthermore, the District Court had not adequately addressed their arguments concerning the injection of K.M. with substances that were contra-indicated, given her condition, or the over-dosage thereof which, he alleged, had caused her death.",
                "26.  On 4 September 2008 the Criminal Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal and upheld the decision of the District Court. In doing so, it stated that there was no necessity to summon A.G. and the nurse to testify in court since they had already made statements during the inquiry. As regards the applicant\u2019s arguments with regard to the contra\u2011indication of medical substances administered by injection to K.M., the Court of Appeal relied on the forensic medical opinions according to which their administration had been correct, taking into account the convulsion syndrome at that moment.",
                "27.  On 30 September 2008 the applicant lodged an appeal with the Court of Cassation against the decision of the Court of Appeal.",

                "7.  The applicants called Kolonos Police Station and the police sergeant in charge, acting as an interrogation officer, arrived at the scene to conduct an on-site inspection. In his report he stated that there were no signs of forced entry at any of the entrances to the residence, and no footprints or other marks on the balcony. He also noted that there was no mess in the residence nor were there any suspicious packets of drugs or other substances in the apartment or in the refuse containers. He did not conduct a search for fingerprints. No photos were taken of the place of death and no DNA test was performed on the rope by which Mr Tsalikidis was hanged. There was no suicide note.",
                "8.  The body was transferred to the morgue, where an autopsy was performed on the body the next day by G.D.L., a coroner with the Forensic Medical Service of Athens. On 20 April 2005 he wrote an autopsy report in which he stated that there were no injuries to the body and that there were signs of pulmonary oedema. The rope mark encircled the cervical spine with a knot at the right of the occiput (\u03ba\u03c5\u03ba\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b7 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b5\u03be\u03b9\u03ac \u03b9\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u03c7\u03ce\u03c1\u03b1). The toxicology examination showed a small amount of alcohol at 0.12%. The hyoid bone and larynx appeared normal. It was concluded that the cause of death was hanging by a noose (\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1 \u03b2\u03c1\u03cc\u03b3\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5). No inspection of the place of death was performed by the coroner and in his report neither the temperature nor the weight of the body was recorded.",
                "9.  On 9 February 2006, following the public announcement concerning the wiretapping case (see \u00a7\u00a7 14 \u2013 17 below) and while the investigation into his brother\u2019s death was still ongoing, the first applicant lodged a criminal complaint with the public prosecutor\u2019s office, asking for the scope of the investigation to be expanded. He requested in particular that the authorities examine the possible connection between his brother\u2019s death and the wiretapping case and investigate crimes that might possibly have been committed against him, such as homicide or extortion. He also requested the exhumation of his brother\u2019s body in order to search for specific poisons and other signs of homicide and declared his wish to join the proceedings as a civil party.",
                "10.  Various witness testimonies were taken from colleagues, friends and family members of the deceased. In her testimonies dated 12 and 17 March 2005 and 7 February 2006, his fianc\u00e9e stated that she had spoken twice with him on the phone the night preceding his death without noticing anything particular. She expressed the view that he could not possibly have committed suicide, citing the fact that two days before he had asked her to book rooms for an excursion they were planning to make two weeks later and that he had expressed concerns about his mother\u2019s health. Lastly, she stated that about a month before his death he had confided to her that \u201cit was a matter of life and death for him to leave his job with V.\u201d and that \u201cV. was facing a serious problem that threatened its very existence\u201d.",
                "11.  From the testimonies of his colleagues and his fianc\u00e9e it was evident that Mr Tsalikidis was sociable and had been well-respected in his work environment. Even though he had been under a lot of pressure at work, his colleagues expressed doubts as to whether stress could have driven him to suicide. He had expressed a wish to quit his job about a month before his death but had later changed his mind after a few days\u2019 leave. On the night of his death he had sent a work-related email to his colleagues at around 4.30 a.m. The content of the email was unremarkable. It was also alleged that on 7 March 2005 there had been a tense meeting at work in which he, amongst others, had been reprimanded by his superiors. His colleagues also testified that he had been responsible for holding monthly meetings with company E., one of V.\u2019s providers, at which they discussed new versions of software and other technical issues.",
                "12.  Testimony was also taken from coroner F.K., the head of the Forensic Science Service of Athens University. In his statement dated 9 March 2006, he attempted to explain the lack of typical signs of hanging \u2013 such as injuries caused by body spasms or cyanosis of the face \u2013 by attributing the death to cardiac arrest caused by simultaneous pressure to the two carotid arteries. He also mentioned that the rope mark on the deceased man\u2019s neck had been typical in cases of hanging; it had been obliquely directed (\u03bb\u03bf\u03be\u03ac \u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b7) and the knot had been an \u201cordinary, everyday knot\u201d. In his view, a possible exhumation and/or toxicology test would be of no added value.",
                "13.  In the light of the foregoing testimonies and having taken all evidence into account, on 20 June 2006 the public prosecutor at the Athens Court of First Instance issued order no. 80/20-6-06 archiving the case, having concluded that there were no indications of any criminal acts committed against Mr Tsalikidis, even though his death was causally linked with the wiretapping case. On 25 September 2006 the decision was upheld by order no. 565/25-9-06 issued by the public prosecutor at the Court of Appeal following an appeal against it by the first applicant.",
                "14.  On 2 February 2006 the Minister of Public Order made a statement informing the public that since June 2004 (two months before the Olympic Games) the telephones of many state officials had been tapped through spyware that had been implanted in the network of phone operator V. The wiretap, installed by persons unknown, had targeted more than 100 of Greece\u2019s State officials, including the Prime Minister and many senior members of the Cabinet. The spyware diverted phone conversations made by V.\u2019s subscribers to fourteen \u201cshadow\u201d pay-as-you-go mobile phones, allowing calls to be monitored.",
                "15.  Following a parliamentary investigation, it was made known that the unauthorised spyware had been implanted in a software provided by company E. to phone operator V. Mr Tsalikidis had been responsible for accepting the software from E. on behalf of V. and met representatives from E. on a monthly basis in order to discuss new versions of the software and other technical issues.",
                "16.  V. was informed by E. that their network had been used to wiretap State officials on 4 March 2005. On 8 March 2005 G.K., a senior manager with V., ordered that the newly discovered software be deactivated and removed from its systems. On 10 March 2005 he informed the Ministers of Justice and of Public Order and the director of the Prime Minister\u2019s office about the existence of the software. A criminal investigation was ordered but its conclusions are not apparent from the material in the Court\u2019s possession.",
                "17.  The wiretapping affair assumed large dimensions both within and outside Greece, and the investigation was widely reported in the media. Mr Tsalikidis\u2019 death occurred the day after the spyware had been removed from V.\u2019s network and the day before the relevant ministers were informed and this fact was mentioned in all the newspaper articles, suggesting an association between his death and the wiretapping affair without his involvement in the case being established.",
                "18.  On 8 February 2012, citing new evidence, the applicants requested that the public prosecutor at the Athens Court of First Instance reopen the case file for the purposes either of initiating criminal proceedings in rem for intentional homicide and/or exposure to peril and/or felonious extortion, or for launching a supplementary preliminary investigation into the aforementioned offences or any other offence that might have been committed. The applicants also declared that they wished to join the proceedings as civil parties.",
                "19.  The first evidence submitted by the applicants was a forensic report dated 12 November 2010 prepared at their request by a British expert, Dr S.K. The expert wrote his report \u2212 in English \u2212 on the basis of his examination of a number of documents from the case file which had been translated into that language. The relevant parts of his report read as follows:\n\u201c... 2. In forming my opinion I have had to rely on a relatively limited group of materials including the original autopsy report translated by Mr Peter Tsalikidis, a set of colour scene photographs (it is not clear to me who took these photographs), scans of white and black photos showing an unclothed body with a ligature mark on mid\u2011-neck (the detail is poor) and a website videos that were produced for an expos\u00e9 produced by the Al-Jazeera network.\n... 5. On April 8 I received two emails from Mr Tsalikidis. The first was an extract of comments taken from a report issued by the Forensic Institute in Athens. The report states that the ligature was \u201cupwardly directed\u201d, a statement that appears to be contradicted by the photographs I have seen. Mr Tsalikidis also claims he was told that \u201cthe death was instant because of simultaneous pressure to the carotid bags (sic - this should be \u2018arteries\u2019)\u201d. This statement, too, is inconsistent with the normal colouration of the face as shown in the photographs. 6. On March 29 I was sent a link to a website dedicated to this case... The video also contains several images and statements that are confusing. These include (1) photograph of the suspensory knot \u2013 it is a complex knot, and definitely not the sort of knots seen in routine suicides. I do not know if the deceased possessed the requisite skills needed to tie such a complex knot. The video narrator stated that the body was hanging 3 inches from the floor. In spite of the short distance, it is possible for someone to hang themselves at this low height. In fact, it is not uncommon.\n... 8. ... The photographs do show that the deceased was unclothed; they also showed an obvious ligature mark that was located in mid-neck, parallel to the shoulders.\n...\nGross Autopsy Findings 10. Neither the height nor the weight of the deceased was supplied. Neither the core temperature of the cadaver nor the ambient room temperature was recorded. It appears that the autopsy was performed the next day, but whether the cadaver was refrigerated is not stated and, since core temperature was not obtained, it would have been irrelevant anyway. No attempt whatsoever was made to identify the time of death... No fibres were taken from the ligature for identification and no tissue taken from the ligature were taken for microscopic examination.\nDiscussion 1. The position of the rope mark is more consistent with strangulation than hanging \u2013 in cases of strangulation the ligature mark, as it was here, tends to encircle the entire neck without deviation upward or downward, and almost invariable there is a gap where the rope suspends the body. Hanging marks are almost always higher on the neck than strangulation marks. The marks present here are more consistent with strangulation. 2. From the photographs I saw there was no evidence of hypostasis (accumulation of blood in the legs that is to be expected after a normal hanging). This argues strongly against hanging.\n... 4. Perhaps more importantly, one expects to see some sort of soft tissue damage within the underlying neck. Injuries are present in at least 1/3 of hangings. No damage was seen within the neck, which is worrisome. The absence of soft tissue injury does not rule out hanging, but if it had been present, a much more convincing case for strangulation could have been made. 5. Damage to the lining of the great vessels in the neck is a frequent finding in strangulation, but that examination was never performed (in fact, no microscopic examination was performed). This means the autopsy was incomplete by U.S. and EU standards. 6. The colour of the face could only be described as normal; typically, victims of manual strangulation will have deeply congested haemorrhagic faces, but victims of hanging often have pale faces \u2013 in this particular instance the colour of the face is so normal that it almost appears that neither strangulation nor hanging occurred. 7. While adequate examination is not possible only from inspecting photographs, the knot used to anchor the rope appears quite complex. This might be expected if the deceased had nautical experience, but the family insists he did not. 8. Homicidal hanging is very rare, since it is very difficult for one person to hang another, unless of course they had been drugged first. The autopsy report says that blood and urine were tested for alcohol and that the results show the deceased had been drinking (post-mortem alcohol production of that magnitude does not occur that quickly). I think it would be very important to know if any other drugs were present. If testing was not done at the time of autopsy, exhumation and testing of the hair is still possible. The results, whether positive or negative, would be definitive. 9. The medical examiner commented on the presence of pulmonary oedema. Such may occur after hanging, but histological studies have shown that pulmonary oedema is much more common after strangulation. 10. There were no scratch marks on the neck, suggesting the deceased made no effort to claw the rope away from his neck. This is also consistent with his having been sedated.\nDiscussion\nObviously, there is no evidence of forceful strangulation and, in the absence of visible trauma, homicidal hanging would appear to be out of the question. The fact that there was minimal suspension does not rule out suicide. Having said that, the case has a number of disturbing features: (1) the autopsy was grossly inadequate, and even if signs of homicide had been present, they would have been missed; (2) the face was of normal colour \u2013 neither congested nor pale; this argues for death before hanging; (3) there was no accumulation of blood in the lower extremities \u2013 this absence argues against hanging altogether; (4) the furrow around the neck is in a position more often seen in strangulation than suicide; (5) none of the normal scratch marks normally seen outside of the neck when individuals hang themselves were evident. Nor, according to the autopsy pathologist, there none of the soft tissue injuries that are normally expected in hanging. Two other issues are of concern: (1) was the deceased able to tie the complex knot used to support him, and (2) it appears that complete toxicology testing (was not) performed and that is a very serious omission. There are many poisons that are not detected by routine tests \u2013 they are only identified if they are specifically sought. In the absence to these questions, the possibility of murder must be strongly considered. The most likely scenario, based on the evidence at hand, is that the deceased was sedated/poisoned and hung after death.\u201d",
                "20.  The second evidence adduced by the applicants was an undated report produced at the applicants\u2019 request by Coroner Th.V. His report was prepared on the basis of the documents in the criminal case file.",
                "21.  Coroner Th.V. emphasised that any assessment of a forensic report should be done with great caution; nevertheless, he stressed that in the initial autopsy there had been serious omissions. He identified in particular the lack of reference to the existence or not of haemorrhagic infiltration where the rope was positioned, as well as the precise position of the rope with reference to the neck (obliquely or vertically directed). He further criticised the failure to search for injuries to the inner part of carotid arteries which could have shown whether Mr Tsalikidis had been hanged or strangled.",
                "22.  Coroner Th. V. included in his report a number of elements of evidence which precluded certain conclusions as to the cause of death. In particular, he stressed the absence of signs usually found in cases of hanging, that is to say cyanosis of the face, oedema of the face, and projection of the tongue, all of which were not present in this case. He furthermore described as strange, taking account of the place where the body was hanging, the complete absence of any injuries resulting from the usual body spasms, causing it to crash against nearby furniture and walls.",
                "23.  In respect of the written statement given by F.K., who attempted to explain the lack of typical signs of hanging by attributing Mr Tsalikidis\u2019 death to cardiac arrest, coroner Th. V. stated that such manner of death was not very probable as it usually occurs in cases of pressure applied to the neck with the hands. In any event, this cause of death is still much debated in the medical community.",
                "24.  Lastly, coroner Th.V. mentioned that a large number of poisons cannot be detected through routine examination. He opined that if exhumation of the body were to be ordered, then toxic substances could possibly be found as they can be detected even years later. A fresh examination of the place of death could also prove useful as long as the place was still intact. In any event, coroner Th. V. considered that the available evidence was not sufficient to allow it to be established whether Mr Tsalikidis\u2019 death had been the result of suicide or homicide.",
                "25.  As third evidence the applicants submitted a letter dated 15 June 2010 written by the President of the Committee on Institutions and Transparency of the Greek Parliament and addressed to the public prosecutor at the Court of Cassation in which the former expressed the view that there had not been sufficient investigation of the relationship between the death of Costas Tsalikidis and the wiretapping affair. They also cited a public statement made on 5 September 2011 by the former President of the Parliamentary Committee of Institutions and Transparency, who was then already Minister of Justice, that \u201cthe question of whether Costas Tsalikidis committed suicide or was murdered will always remain open\u201d.",
                "26.  In view of the above evidence, the applicants requested the reopening of the case file. They requested in particular that the following investigative measures be implemented: phone operator V. to be ordered to provide the minutes of the meeting that took place the day before Mr Tsalikidis was found dead, representatives of V. to confirm officially that Mr Tsalikidis was the person responsible for accepting on behalf of their company the legal software provided by company E. which was used to activate the program of wiretapping, a forensic examination of the place of death and a reconstruction of the circumstances of the death to be conducted, exhumation and new toxicology tests to be run, a cross\u2011examination of the applicants\u2019 technical advisors together with coroners G.D.L. and F.K. to be organised, a new forensic report to be drawn up by another coroner, an expert report to be produced concerning the knot, technical advisors S.K. and Th. V. to be summoned to testify, and witness statements to be taken again in the light of the new evidence acquired. They stressed in particular that the scope of the investigation should include the deletion of the illegally installed software from the network of V. and why it was removed before the authorities had been informed.",
                "27.  By document no. E 2006/1200/29-2-2012, issued by the public prosecutor at the Athens Court of First Instance on 29 February 2012 and addressed to the public prosecutor at the Athens Court of Appeal, approval was sought to reopen the case file pursuant to Article 43 \u00a7 3 (a) and Article 47 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. On 7 March 2012 the request was granted and a supplementary preliminary investigation was ordered.",
                "28.  On 20 April 2012 the public prosecutor at the Athens Court of First Instance ordered the exhumation of Mr Tsalikidis\u2019 body, the conduct of a new forensic autopsy and the execution of all laboratory tests to be carried out in a laboratory in the presence of the technical advisors appointed by the applicants.",
                "29.  The exhumation took place on 3 May 2012 in the presence of coroners I.B., N.K. and Ch.S. and the applicants\u2019 technical advisor Th.V., and biological material was sent to the Universities of Athens and Crete for the purpose of conducting toxicology tests. According to toxicology report no. 1313/7-12-2012, drawn up on 7 December 2012 by the Forensic Science Laboratory of the Toxicology Unit of the University of Crete, and forensic report no. 865/25-11-2013 on the exhumed body, drawn up on 25 November 2013 by the Forensic and Toxicology Laboratory of the School of Medicine of Athens University, the results were negative as regards the presence of poison or medication. However, in both reports it was stressed that the absence of a positive finding did not preclude the possibility of the administration of poison or medication to the deceased, since a number of factors, such as the lapse of time, could have affected the results.",
                "30.  According to histology report no. 889/12/26-2-2013 drawn up on 26 February 2013 by the First Pathological Anatomy Laboratory of the School of Medicine of Athens University, the deceased\u2019s hyoid bone was found to be broken. However, owing to the absence of surrounding soft tissue, it was not possible to say whether it had been broken ante-mortem or post-mortem.",
                "31.  On the basis of the above-mentioned findings, the three coroners each prepared a new forensic report. Coroners I.B. and N.K., in their reports numbered 1408/2561/30-4-2012/10-7-2013 and 1287/18-6-2013 and drawn up on 10 July 2013 and on 18 June 2013 respectively, commented on the findings of the toxicology reports and histology report and concluded that the cause of Mr Tsalikidis\u2019 death remained unclarified due to the passage of time. Coroner Ch.S. prepared a similar report dated 25 November 2013 commenting on the above\u2011mentioned findings without any reference to the cause of death.",
                "32.  The applicants also requested that a psychiatric report be included in the case file, and one was duly prepared at their request. Dr A.D. studied the case file documents and conducted interviews with the first applicant and the deceased\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. His report dated 12 April 2012 stated that the deceased did not betray any of the personality characteristics associated with a suicide risk. In addition, no other factors such as health issues or financial problems were detected as being of concern, and in general, no plausible grounds for suicide were identified. In the doctor\u2019s opinion, his support system of friends and family, his short-term (excursion) and long\u2011term (wedding) plans, together with the absence of any risk factors, were all indications that Mr Tsalikidis did not commit suicide.",
                "33.  On 16 June 2014 the public prosecutor at the Athens Court of First Instance, with the approval of the public prosecutor at the Court of Appeal, closed the supplementary investigation, concluding that the above\u2011mentioned reports, considered in conjunction with the evidence gathered during the main investigation, were sufficient to allow the case file to be archived, thereby upholding the conclusions of order 80/06 issued by the public prosecutor at the Athens Court of First Instance (order no. 14/3859/16-6-2014)."

The doctor stated that the patient had received tuberculosis treatment until late May 2010, when he had refused to take any drugs.",
                "25.  On 6 December 2010, citing statements by Ms I., the investigating authorities concluded that there had been no appearance of negligence on the part of the medical authorities. They decided not to open a criminal case.",
                "26.  Three weeks later a higher-ranking investigator overruled that decision, noting that the investigation had not been thorough, in particular, because no medical documents had been collected.",
                "27.  The investigator again refused to open a criminal case on 5 January 2011. That decision was annulled by the higher-ranking authority on 15 March 2011 for want of necessary investigative measures, in view of the investigator\u2019s failure to rectify the shortcomings already identified in the previous review decisions.",
                "28.  Twelve days after the annulment of his previous decision, the investigator again refused to open a criminal case, having based his new decision on the same evidence and arguments as before.",
                "29.  In the meantime, Mr K. submitted a new criminal complaint to the Central Inter-district Department of the Investigative Committee in the Republic of Tatarstan. The authorities were called on to verify whether the alleged inaction of the medical authorities had amounted to the deprivation of medical care, an offence under the Russian Criminal Code. On 10 May 2011 the case was forwarded to the Promyshlennyiy district police station in Kazan.",
                "30.  A police investigator interviewed a tuberculosis specialist, who had treated Mr Kaimov, and a prison nurse. They unanimously stated that the patient had refused treatment.",
                "31.  On 29 May 2011 the investigator refused to open a criminal case. Relying on the above statements and Mr Kaimov\u2019s medical history, he found that the latter\u2019s death had resulted from his own careless decision in not taking the prescribed drugs, and that the medical authorities had taken all reasonable steps to convince him to re-initiate the treatment.",
                "32.  The first applicant appealed against the decision of 29 May 2011. Her appeal was rejected, in the final instance, by the Supreme Court of the Tatarstan Republic on 11 October 2011. The courts concluded that the investigation into Mr Kaimov\u2019s death had been thorough and comprehensive. The decision refusing the institution of criminal proceedings had been based on the examination of the medical file and statements by a number of witnesses, including the medical personnel of the prison hospital. The courts endorsed the investigator\u2019s conclusion that Mr Kaimov had refused treatment and had not followed the recommendations of the medical personnel. The courts also noted that the first applicant had been aware of Mr Kaimov\u2019s behaviour and had not made any complaints about the quality of the treatment at that time.",
                "33.  Following the communication of the application to the Russian Government, they submitted that on 13 and 26 February 2015 the decisions of 27 March and 29 May 2011, respectively, had been overruled by higher\u2011ranking officials and additional investigative measures had been ordered. In particular, a medical expert examination was to be performed.",
                "34.  According to the applicants\u2019 correspondence of 3 July 2015, the criminal investigation was pending. There is no further information about the outcome."

The applicant started to run and fell. The police officers then arrested him. During his arrest some money fell out of the applicant\u2019s pockets.",
                "7.  According to the Government, since the applicant was resisting arrest, the police officers had to apply force (the so-called armlock technique).",
                "8.  According to the applicant, he was beaten by the police officers while lying on the ground.",
                "9.  At 5 p.m. officers D.P. (the chief officer on duty in the IV Zagreb police station) and N.V. (the deputy head of IV Zagreb police station) were informed of the use of force against the applicant. The applicant was taken to the police station at 5.15 p.m. The applicant complained to Officer S.P. that his shoulder hurt. S.P. informed D.P. of this and the latter ordered that the emergency medical service be called. At 5.56 p.m. D.P. informed the Zagreb police operative centre about the use of force against the applicant. The applicant was seen by an emergency doctor between 7.40 p.m. and 7.57 p.m. He was transferred to the Sisters of Charity Hospital in Zagreb (Klini\u010dki bolni\u010dki centar Sestre milosrdnice) and was seen there by a surgeon at 8.11 p.m. An X-ray examination revealed that the applicant\u2019s right shoulder was broken. The applicant told the doctor that he had fallen during his arrest. He was provided with medical assistance for these injuries and then returned to the police station at 9.40 p.m. Officer D.P. questioned the applicant in connection with the criminal offence for which he had been arrested and the applicant stated that he wished to remain silent.",
                "10.  The applicant was again seen by a surgeon in the same hospital on 24 December 2012 and surgery was recommended.",
                "11.  The applicant was hospitalised in the Sisters of Mercy Hospital between 27 and 31 December 2012. He underwent surgery and it was established that his shoulder was broken in four places; his upper arm was also broken. He had an artificial shoulder implanted.",
                "12.  An internal investigation into the use of force against the applicant was immediately initiated within the Zagreb police on 20 December 2012. Officer D.P. took a statement from the applicant who said that he had sustained an injury \u201cby the police officers\u201d and that he did \u201cnot want to say anything else\u201d. Officers V.B. and I.J. compiled a joint report on the use of force against the applicant. Later on, each of them provided a separate report. All these reports alleged that the applicant, in attempting to flee from the police officers, had fallen and that while on the ground had actively resisted the police officers, who had then applied the armlock technique and handcuffed him.",
                "13.  On 21 December 2012 an internal police investigator of the Zagreb police, officer A.L., compiled a report on the basis of the documents, statements from Officers V.B., I.J. and D.P. and his interview with the applicant. In his report A.L. stated that the applicant had attempted to run from the said officers and had fallen. While on the ground he had actively resisted arrest and the officers had applied the armlock technique. A.L. concluded that the applicant had resisted the police officers since some money had fallen out of his clothes. A.L. was of the opinion that the force applied by officers V.B. and I.J. against the applicant had had a \u201cbasis in law and [had been] justified\u201d.",
                "14.  On 21 December 2012 the head of IV police station in Zagreb, S.T., compiled a report for the public-order division of the Zagreb police, on the basis of the report of A.L. S.T. stated that the applicant had said that he had fallen and that the police officers had caught him and applied force against him and denied that he had resisted arrest. In a short report of 28 December 2012 the head of the Zagreb police, G.B., concluded that the information gathered had shown that the use of force by Officers V.B. and I.J. against the applicant had been lawful and justified.",
                "15.  On 28 December 2012 the head of the Zagreb police informed the head of IV police station in Zagreb that, on the basis of the report of A.L., he considered the force used by officers V.B. and I.J. against the applicant to have had a \u201cbasis in law and [to have been] justified\u201d",
                "16.  On 3 January 2013 the head of the Zagreb police sent the case file concerning the internal police investigation to the Internal Control Service of the Ministry of the Interior. Upon inspecting the file the Internal Control Service instructed the police to forward the file to the Zagreb Municipal State Attorney\u2019s Office (hereinafter the \u201cZMSAO\u201d) for further assessment.",

On the instructions of the head of the Zagreb police, on 5 February 2013 the IV police station in Zagreb sent a report on the events at issue together with the applicant\u2019s medical report to the ZMSAO. The documents in the case file do not indicate that the ZMSAO carried out any further steps at that time.",
                "18.  On 6 February 2013, upon a request by the applicant\u2019s lawyer, the head of the IV police station in Zagreb shortly informed the applicant\u2019s lawyer that the force used against the applicant by the two police officers had had a basis in law and had been justified. The applicant\u2019s request to have access to the internal report on the use of force against him was denied on 11 February 2013 on the grounds that it was a classified document.",
                "19.  On 15 May 2013 the head of IV police station in Zagreb compiled a report for the legal, financial and technical tasks division of the Zagreb police, where he described in detail the events at issue and the results of the internal police investigation with a final conclusion that the use of force against the applicant had had a basis in law and had been justified.",
                "20.  On 28 July 2014 the applicant lodged a criminal complaint with the ZMSAO against Officers V.B. and I.J.",
                "21.  The applicant alleged that during his arrest on 20 December 2012 police officers V.B. and I.J. had forced him to the ground and then hit, kicked and verbally insulted him and unnecessarily twisted his arm, owing to which he had sustained injuries, such as a broken arm and shoulder. The officers had then taken him to a police station where they continued to beat him. Only after three hours had he been taken to hospital. The doctors had recommended urgent surgery but the police officers had not allowed it. Instead, they had taken him back to the police station where they had continued to hit and insult him. In the evening he had been admitted to Zagreb Prison.",
                "22.  The prosecuting authorities obtained the statements previously given by the applicant and the police officers involved.",
                "23.  The ZMSAO attempted to contact the applicant on six occasions between 27 November 2014 and 15 September 2015. However, these attempts were unsuccessful since the applicant had changed his address and had not replied to the telephone calls on the mobile telephone number provided by his lawyer.",

                "25.  On 13 October 2015 the ZMSAO interviewed the applicant, who said that during his arrest on 20 December 2012 one of the police officers, when applying the armlock technique, had broken his right arm. He had complained to the officers of intense pain but they had ignored his complaints. During his transport to the police station he had again complained about the pain in his arm but the officers had only told him to shut up. Upon his arrival at the police station he had continued to complain about the pain in his arm, but had been ignored. Only after a few hours had a doctor been called. The applicant admitted that he had told the doctor that he had sustained the injury to his right arm and shoulder when he had fallen during his arrest. He also said that during the arrest and later on in the police station, none of the police officers had hit or kicked him. He said that in the relevant period he had been abusing both alcohol and drugs.",

                "7.  In 2004 Mr R. arrived at correctional colony no. 4 in the Arkhangelsk Region where he was to serve his twelve-year sentence. On admission to that facility, he underwent a general medical check-up permed by a prison doctor who concluded that he was healthy. Two routine chest X-ray examinations in March and October 2004 confirmed that conclusion.",
                "8.  On 10 March 2005 Mr R. complained to the prison medical authorities of fatigue and a cough. Acute rhinopharyngitis was diagnosed and a standard treatment for that condition was prescribed, but the symptoms persisted. Eleven days later, the prison doctor diagnosed acute pneumonia of the left lung. Mr R. was admitted to the prison medical unit and prescribed medication and a special dietary regime.",
                "9.  On 6 April 2005, in view of the absence of any positive changes in Mr R.\u2019s health, he was moved to a prison tuberculosis hospital. A chest X\u2011ray examination performed on the day of his admission showed a massive infiltration in the lungs.",
                "10.  The next day Mr R. underwent a sputum test, which revealed his affliction with tuberculosis combined with pneumonia. Treatment with five first-line drugs was prescribed. It was started about two weeks later, but had no effect on Mr R.\u2019s health.",
                "11.  On 12 April 2005 a drug susceptibility test was performed. The test result was only received on 18 July 2005 (see paragraph 15 below). An additional chest X-ray examination on 18 April 2005 indicated further progress of the diseases.",
                "12.  In the light of the above, on 23 April 2005 Mr R. was transferred to the Arkhangelsk regional prison tuberculosis hospital (\u201cregional prison hospital\u201d), where his treatment continued as previously prescribed.",
                "13.  According to the applicant, Mr R. was unsatisfied with the quality of his treatment. In early May 2005 both the applicant and Mr R. unsuccessfully sought the latter\u2019s transfer to a medical facility located in a southern region, where Mr R. could have been provided with adequate treatment in a more suitable climate.",
                "14.  In the meantime, regular chest X-ray examinations showed that Mr R.\u2019s health was continuing to deteriorate. By mid-July 2005 pulmonary cavities had appeared, and his condition had become serious.",
                "15.  On 18 July 2005 the regional prison hospital received the result of the drug susceptibility test of 12 April 2005. It revealed that Mr R.\u2019s tuberculosis was resistant to four antibiotics being used in his treatment.",
                "16.  According to a medical entry made at the top of a page outside the related fields in Mr R.\u2019s medical file, on 28 July 2005 he was prescribed treatment with advanced antibiotics. There are no regular entries showing the actual intake of the new drugs.",
                "17.  In August 2005 Mr R.\u2019s condition was assessed as \u201cof medium gravity\u201d, but on 10 September 2005 he died. According to an autopsy report drawn up two days later, the cause of death was cardio-respiratory insufficiency provoked by tuberculosis.",
                "18.  In September 2006 the applicant asked for criminal proceedings to be instituted into the circumstances leading to his son\u2019s death. He alleged that the authorities responsible for protecting the life and well\u2011being of his son had failed to comply with their obligations.",
                "19.  On 21 October 2006 the Primorskiy Inter-District Prosecutor\u2019s Office refused to open a criminal case. Its page-long decision was based on the autopsy report and general information on Mr R.\u2019s treatment submitted by the prison medical authorities. The investigator concluded that Mr R. had died of tuberculosis for which he had received medical treatment, and that the patient\u2019s detention in a northern region had not breached Russian law.",
                "20.  In November 2006 the applicant repeated his request, having argued that the custodial authorities bore responsibility for his son\u2019s death because they had failed to protect him from tuberculosis and to ensure prompt diagnosis of the disease.",
                "21.  By a letter of 9 January 2007 a prosecutor informed the applicant that a criminal inquiry had established that his son had contracted tuberculosis in early March 2005. The correctional colony had promptly identified the disease and had ensured treatment keeping the disease under control. The investigating authorities did not assess the quality of the medical services provided between late April and September 2005.",
                "22.  The applicant appealed against the decision of 21 October 2006, insisting that the investigator\u2019s finding had not been supported by expert evidence. He further argued that the detention authorities had failed not only to diagnose his son\u2019s tuberculosis promptly, but also to provide him with adequate care in the regional prison hospital.",
                "23.  On 3 July 2007 the Isakogorskiy District Court of Arkhangelsk examined the claim. Ms B., the head of the regional prison hospital\u2019s unit responsible for Mr R.\u2019s treatment, was heard. She stated that Mr R. had been admitted to the hospital on 23 April 2005. Shortly thereafter he had undergone medical testing. Ms B. stressed that the testing had been complex and that the hospital had only received the test result in August 2005. On 26 August 2005 the doctors had learned that Mr R.\u2019s tuberculosis had been drug resistant. They had prescribed treatment with advanced antibiotics. However, by that time pathological changes in the patient\u2019s body had already become irreversible.",
                "24.  Having regard to the investigation file, the court noted that the investigating authorities had solicited neither the autopsy report nor medical documents concerning Mr R.\u2019s treatment and that they had not interviewed any doctor involved in the treatment. The court thus concluded that the criminal inquiry had not been thorough. It overruled the prosecutor\u2019s decision of 21 October 2006 not to open a criminal case.",
                "25.  On 14 August 2007 the Arkhangelsk Regional Court quashed the District Court\u2019s decision on appeal. It noted that it was not for the investigative authorities to assess all possible versions of the events and that there was no obligation on them to resolve each inconsistency in the case. The court found that the documents obtained by the first\u2011instance court and the statement by Ms B. had remedied the alleged shortcomings in the investigation. The case was remitted to the District Court for a fresh examination.",
                "26.  Ten days later the District Court re-examined the case. It concluded that the criminal inquiry had been carried out in compliance with the requirements of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure, and that the impugned decision of 21 October 2006 had been based on sufficient evidence duly assessed by the investigating authorities. The applicant\u2019s claim was accordingly rejected.",

                "10.  The applicant submitted that the detention room in which he had been kept was in an ordinary police detention facility where arrestees were held for short periods (generally one day). During his detention, many people were detained in the room, at times as many as 10-12 people. The room was around 10 sq. m and there was no heating or ventilation, and no bed. Nor did it receive any natural light. He was confined in that room and was exceptionally allowed to use the other parts of the detention facility. He could use the hall in the centre of the facility only when his family members visited him. The applicant was provided with a mattress and a blanket and he slept on the floor. He was never taken out of the detention facility and did not have access to exercise in the open air. The facility had no shower and he therefore had to wash himself in the toilets. As he suffered from asthma, anaemia and back problems, he needed medical assistance. However, he was taken to hospital on only one occasion.",

                "12.  In their submissions dated 18 January 2017, the Government submitted that the applicant had been detained in the \u201ccustody cell\u201d of the public security branch of the Yalova police headquarters. The custody cell in question was used as a foreigners\u2019 detention centre because there was no separate foreigners\u2019 detention centre in Yalova at that time. The Government stated that the custody facility measured approximately 92 sq. m and consisted of two detention rooms of 12.8 sq. m and 17.6 sq. m, two toilets (3.5 and 5.7 sq. m respectively), a room for the taking of police statements of 13.5 sq. m, a room used for interviews between arrestees and their lawyers of 6 sq. m, and an identification parade room of 6 sq. m. There was also a hall in the centre of the facility, which measured 21 sq. m, onto which the detention rooms opened. The hall had an air conditioner and two windows measuring 70 x 93 cm and 150 x 205 cm which provided natural light for the detention rooms.",
                "13.  In their additional observations dated 23 May 2017, the Government submitted that foreign nationals and Turkish nationals detained in the context of criminal investigations were kept separately in two detention rooms in the facility in question. They stated that at the material time the Turkish nationals had been kept locked in one of the detention rooms and that the applicant and other foreign nationals had had access at all times to the hall in the centre of the facility \u2212 where there were chairs and a table \u2013 and to the toilets. When there were no Turkish national detainees, the foreign nationals also had access to both detention rooms.",
                "14.  In support of their submissions the Government submitted a sketch map of the detention facility and a total of thirty-nine photographs. Nine of these photographs were taken outside and show the police station building. Eleven photographs were taken in the toilets, which appeared clean. There is a shower head installed in each of the toilets. Nine other photographs show the room for the taking of police statements, the room used for interviews between arrestees and their lawyers, and the identification parade room. Lastly, nine further photographs show the detention rooms and the hall. It is apparent that the detention rooms are separated from the hall by bars. There are no beds in the detention rooms but along their three walls there are concrete benches topped with a cushion. On the benches there are blankets, apparently used both for covering and as pillows. The detention rooms do not have windows but appear to receive light from the hall. The photographs of the hall show that there are two windows, a table and chairs on which towels were put in that area.",
                "15.  The Government also submitted custody registers showing the occupation rates at the detention facility for the period between 4 November 2013 and 7 January 2014. According to those documents, the applicant was detained alone for thirty-one days and for thirty days he was detained together with between one and six foreign nationals. On 26 November 2013 there were seven foreign nationals, including the applicant, detained at the facility. On 27 and 28 November 2013 the applicant was detained together with eleven other foreign nationals.",
                "16.  For thirty days between 4 November 2013 and 7 January 2014, there had been no Turkish nationals detained at the facility. In particular, on 26, 27 and 28 November 2013 no Turkish national had been held in custody. During the remaining thirty-five days, a minimum of one and a maximum of five Turkish nationals had been in detention, except for 1 January 2014, when eleven Turkish nationals had been held in police custody. In particular, on 29 November 2013 one Turkish national had been detained at the facility in question.",

The applicant alleged, inter alia, that the conditions of his detention at the Yalova police headquarters described above had amounted to ill\u2011treatment (see paragraph 10 above).",
                "18.  On 21 January 2015 the Constitutional Court delivered its decision on the admissibility and merits of the applicant\u2019s case. As regards the applicant\u2019s complaint that the conditions of his detention at the Yalova police headquarters had amounted to ill-treatment, the Constitutional Court noted that he had complained that his health had worsened as a result of the conditions in which he had been detained. Since the applicant had been provided with medical assistance when he had fallen ill in detention, the Constitutional Court found that the administrative authorities had taken the necessary measures to protect the applicant\u2019s physical and psychological health. As a result, the court concluded that the treatment of the applicant had not attained the minimum level of severity required to be described as inhuman or degrading treatment.",
                "19.  On 24 June 2015 the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision was served on the applicant\u2019s representative.",
                "20.  The Standards of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cthe CPT\u201d) concerning the conditions of detention of foreign nationals (see the CPT standards, document no. CPT/Inf(97)10-part) provide, in so far as relevant, as follows:\n\u201c27.  In certain countries, CPT delegations have found immigration detainees held in police stations for prolonged periods (for weeks and, in certain cases, months), subject to mediocre material conditions of detention, deprived of any form of activity and on occasion obliged to share cells with criminal suspects. Such a situation is indefensible. 28.  The CPT recognises that, in the very nature of things, immigration detainees may have to spend some time in an ordinary police detention facility. However, conditions in police stations will frequently - if not invariably - be inadequate for prolonged periods of detention. Consequently, the period of time spent by immigration detainees in such establishments should be kept to the absolute minimum. 29.  In the view of the CPT, in those cases where it is deemed necessary to deprive persons of their liberty for an extended period under aliens legislation, they should be accommodated in centres specifically designed for that purpose, offering material conditions and a regime appropriate to their legal situation and staffed by suitably-qualified personnel. 30.  Obviously, such centres should provide accommodation which is adequately-furnished, clean and in a good state of repair, and which offers sufficient living space for the numbers involved. Further, care should be taken in the design and layout of the premises to avoid as far as possible any impression of a carceral environment. As regards regime activities, they should include outdoor exercise, access to a day room and to radio/television and newspapers/magazines, as well as other appropriate means of recreation (e.g. board games, table tennis). The longer the period for which persons are detained, the more developed should be the activities which are offered to them.\n... 79.  Conditions of detention for irregular migrants should reflect the nature of their deprivation of liberty, with limited restrictions in place and a varied regime of activities. For example, detained irregular migrants ... should be restricted in their freedom of movement within the detention facility as little as possible.\u201d"

                "7.  In 2002 the National Anti-Corruption Prosecution Service commenced proceedings against the applicant on charges of involvement in a vast criminal network operating in the economic field, involving several dozen individuals and some one hundred business companies. With the complicity of bank employees, fraudulent appropriations were granted to those companies, which money was then misused for the benefit of the accused.",
                "8.  By final judgment of 28 February 2013 the High Court of Cassation and Justice convicted the applicant on conspiracy charges, sentencing him to three years, four months\u2019 imprisonment.",
                "9.  Meanwhile, in November 2012, the applicant had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. At that time the illness had already reached an advanced stage and the applicant displayed bone metastases, brain haematoma and intraocular haemorrhages. On 27 November 2012 the applicant had been admitted to the Bucharest Institute of Oncology, from which he had been discharged on 11 January 2013. From 14 to 18 January 2013 he had once again been admitted to hospital. He had undergone prostate surgery and begun chemotherapy. He had subsequently had several short stays in hospital. In January 2013 the diagnosis reached by the oncologist had emphasised the seriousness of the applicant\u2019s condition. The prognosis was that he had a short time to live given that the disease had spread to the bone, for which condition the existing treatment was insufficient. On 26 February 2013 the applicant was examined by a medical board, which issued him with a certificate of severe disability.",
                "10.  On 28 February 2013 the applicant was taken into Bac\u0103u Hospital oncology department. His state had worsened and he was suffering from bone pain. The applicant continued his chemotherapy and remained in hospital until 4 March 2013, when he was handed over to police officers who had come to escort him to Bac\u0103u Prison where he was to begin serving his sentence.",
                "11.  On the same day the applicant, through the intermediary of his lawyer, applied to the Bac\u0103u County Court for an interruption of his prison sentence on health grounds. He pointed out that since he could not receive his treatment in prison, his life would be in danger.",
                "12.  On 27 March 2013 he was transferred to the Rahova Prison Hospital. On 5 April 2013 he returned to Bac\u0103u Prison. On 15 April 2013 he was readmitted to the Rahova Prison Hospital, and then transferred back to Bac\u0103u prison on 28 May 2013.",
                "13.  The court commissioned a report on the applicant\u2019s condition from a board of the National Institute of Forensic Medicine. At the board\u2019s request, the applicant underwent several medical examinations, which showed that his condition required radiotherapy sessions and further chemotherapy. Furthermore, it transpired from the medical documents made available to the committee that the applicant had had chemotherapy sessions at Bac\u0103u Hospital on 12 April 2013 and at the Bucharest Institute of Oncology on 10 and 17 May 2013.",
                "14.  In its report of 19 June 2013 the board concluded that the applicant\u2019s survival depended on the medical care with which he was being provided and a complex form of treatment which he could only receive in specialised clinics operating under the Ministry of Health. Consequently, it considered that the court had to order either an interruption of the applicant\u2019s sentence or his hospitalisation under supervision in one of the aforementioned establishments.",
                "15.  On 25 June 2013 the court allowed the applicant\u2019s request and ordered a three-month interruption of his sentence. Having regard to the seriousness of the applicant\u2019s illness, it ruled that hospitalisation under supervision would considerably reduce his chances of survival and recovery owing to the stress and mental suffering caused by the continued execution of his sentence. Moreover, the court emphasised that the applicant posed no threat to public order, that the sentence, one third of which had already been served, was reasonably short and that the applicant\u2019s conduct had been good throughout the criminal proceedings. The prosecution appealed.",
                "16.  The applicant was released on the same day. On 4 and 19 July 2013 he underwent chemotherapy at Bac\u0103u Hospital and continued the treatment on 1 and 16 August 2013 at the Bucharest Institute of Oncology.",
                "17.  On 29 August 2013 the Bac\u0103u Court of Appeal considered the prosecution appeal. By final judgment delivered the same day, it allowed the appeal and dismissed the applicant\u2019s request. Relying on Articles 455 and 453 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereafter \u201cthe CPP\u201d - see paragraph 34 below), the Court of Appeal ruled that the interruption of the applicant\u2019s sentence was unjustified provided that his treatment could continue, under guard, in a civil hospital. In a dissenting opinion, one of the judges on the trial bench considered that the sentence should be interrupted on humanitarian grounds; consequently, having regard to the applicant\u2019s condition, he considered that his continued detention was in breach of the proportionality principle and reduced his chances of survival.",
                "18.  On 31 August 2013 the applicant was imprisoned in Bac\u0103u to serve his sentence. On 24 September 2013 he was transferred to Vaslui Prison. On 27 September 2013 he was admitted to the Rahova Prison hospital. On 3 October 2013 he returned to Vaslui Prison.",

On the same day, noting the deterioration in the applicant\u2019s general condition, a multidisciplinary team from the T\u00e2rgu Ocna Prison hospital placed a prisoner on constant standby to assist the applicant in his everyday activities. That prisoner reportedly assisted the applicant up until the day of his last transfer to Bac\u0103u Hospital (see paragraph 28 below).",
                "20.  On 9 October 2013 the applicant was once again transferred to Bac\u0103u Prison, from whence he was taken, on the same day, to the Bac\u0103u Hospital oncology department. He was unable to move, was suffering from severe bone pain and had almost completely lost his sight and hearing. Furthermore, he was also showing signs of severe depression. His condition was so severe that he could no longer undergo chemotherapy, which was replaced by palliative care.",
                "21.  The applicant remained in the Bac\u0103u Hospital oncology department until 24 October 2013, when he was transferred to Ia\u015fi Prison. On 28 October 2013 he was taken into the Ia\u015fi Regional Institute of Oncology for five palliative radiotherapy sessions geared to alleviating his bone pain. He remained in the institute until 1 November 2013. He lost his sight completely and his depression continued.",
                "22.  On 5 November 2013 he was transferred to Vaslui Prison. On 6 November 2013 he was admitted to the T\u00e2rgu Ocna Prison hospital where he stayed until 12 November 2013, when he was transferred to Bac\u0103u Prison.",
                "23.  On 22 November 2013 the judge delegated to Bac\u0103u Prison granted the applicant the most favourable possible detention regime, allowing him to move around inside prison and to take part in outdoor activities unsupervised.",
                "24.  Still on 22 November 2013, the applicant was admitted to the Bac\u0103u Hospital oncology department. The senior medical officer said that the applicant\u2019s condition could deteriorate suddenly and that he therefore needed round-the-clock medical care. From 25 to 27 November 2013 the applicant received palliative care in the same hospital before being transferred to Bac\u0103u Prison and then to the T\u00e2rgu Ocna Prison hospital.",
                "25.  In reply to a request from the applicant to be released on licence, the Prison Director told him that his request would be examined in 2015.",
                "26.  The applicant wrote to the President of the Romanian Republic and the Director of T\u00e2rgu Ocna Prison to request their assistance regarding his release. He explained that he was dying and that he wanted to have his family present. He pointed out that he was now bedridden, blind and deaf, and that there was no one in prison to assist him in his everyday activities. He added that the doctors had been reluctant to treat him because had was keep under guard and in handcuffs.",
                "27.  The National Administration of Prison Authorities replied that only a court could order his release.",
                "28.  On 4 December 2013 the applicant was transferred to Bac\u0103u Prison and then to Bac\u0103u Hospital, where he remained until 7 December 2013. On that date he was transferred to the T\u00e2rgu Ocna Prison Hospital. On 19 December 2013 he returned to Bac\u0103u Prison and the same day was admitted to the Bac\u0103u Hospital oncology department. He died there on 24 December 2013.",

It transpires from the medical files included in the case file that between 24 January 2013 and 24 December 2013, the date of his death, the applicant was admitted to Bac\u0103u hospital eighteen times, including several hospital stays lasting several days. During those stays he had some fifteen chemotherapy sessions, usually at fortnightly intervals: prior to 24 October 2013 in the framework of the cancer treatment, and after that date, in the framework of palliative treatment. He also received various types of treatment for the illnesses caused by the metastatic progression of his prostate cancer.",
                "30.  In a report drawn up at the Government agent\u2019s request, the senior medical officer at the Bac\u0103u Hospital oncology department highlighted certain dysfunctions in the administration of the treatment. Drawing on the medical files relating to the applicant\u2019s stays in that hospital, he pointed out that on 14 March 2013 the applicant had begun the chemotherapy without having received the radiotherapy recommended by the doctors in his department. He added that the chemotherapy session scheduled for between 28 and 30 March 2013 had not taken place because the applicant had been absent, having been transferred to the Bucharest Institute of Oncology for examinations. Lastly, he noted that on 18 September 2013 the applicant had arrived late at the hospital to continue his chemotherapy. Furthermore, when the applicant had been hospitalised, he had been guarded by two police officers and had remained handcuffed to the bed, even after he had become blind and deaf and was suffering extreme bone pain.",
                "31.  In a report of 21 September 2015, the Ia\u015fi Regional Institute of Oncology pointed out that between 28 October and 1 November 2013, the applicant had had five radiotherapy sessions, had kept the medical appointments made and had been neither handcuffed nor immobilised during those sessions.",
                "32.  In a report of 22 September 2015, the Bucharest Institute of Oncology pointed out that the applicant had been hospitalised several times in the institute between 27 November 2012 and 24 May 2013, primarily for chemotherapy. The institute\u2019s senior medical officer stated in the report that the applicant had duly respected all his medical appointments and that during his stays at the institute he had not been constrained but had been guarded by prison officers.",
                "33.  According to the information provided by the prison authorities, the applicant had been held in Bac\u0103u Prison in a cell measuring 33 m2, which he had shared with six other prisoners. At Rahova Prison hospital he had shared a 38-m2 cell with four other prisoners. At Vaslui Prison, where he was held from 24 to 27 September, from 3 to 4 October and from 5 to 6 November 2013, he had occupied a 14.75-m2 cell with six other prisoners.

He allegedly had a cap put on his head so that he could not see anything and was taken by car out of town, where he was beaten up and given electric shocks with wires attached to his little fingers. His mouth was taped so that he would not scream. When he was ready to give a statement in order to stop the torture, he was taken to a river bank and shown a dead body. He was thrown on the ground and kicked.

He also stated that he had been beaten up and had received all his injuries at the Severnyy police department, but had not been subjected to any ill\u2011treatment at the Sovetskiy police department, and had no complaints against its officers. The applicant was then taken to the place where he had allegedly hidden I.\u2019s body. According to a record drawn up by investigator S., an examination of the place was carried out between 11 p.m. and midnight, and a woman\u2019s body was recovered.",

The applicant reiterated his earlier self\u2011incriminating statements, as well as the statements concerning his ill\u2011treatment at the Severnyy police department. He also stated that he had burnt I.\u2019s body after he had strangled her.

An expert recorded multiple bruises and abrasions on his face, head, trunk and upper and lower extremities. The applicant stated that the injuries had been inflicted after his arrest on 17 June 2006 by police officers who had punched him in the head and different parts of his body and beaten him with a rubber baton on the back and legs. The expert concluded that the injuries could have been inflicted by a blunt object between one and three days before the examination.",

On 28 June 2006 investigator S. communicated the applicant\u2019s allegations concerning the unlawful actions of the police officers from the Severnyy police department to the Kominternovskiy district prosecutor\u2019s office of Voronezh. An investigator of that prosecutor\u2019s office carried out a pre-investigation inquiry and refused to institute criminal proceedings into the applicant\u2019s complaint. His two decisions of 1 July and 2 August 2006 were annulled by his superiors on the grounds that they had been based on an incomplete inquiry.",
                "19.  In the most recent refusal of 29 September 2006 to institute criminal proceedings for lack of evidence that the officers of the Severnyy police department had committed a crime, the investigator established the facts as follows, relying on the police officers\u2019 statements. On 17 June 2006 certain operative officers of the criminal search unit of the Severnyy police department carried out operational-search activities in connection with I.\u2019s disappearance. In order to check the applicant\u2019s involvement in I.\u2019s disappearance they took him to the Severnyy police department with his consent and interviewed him. After receiving his \u201cexplanation\u201d M. released him. That evening M. took him to the police station again for swearing on the street near the police station. From 9.50 p.m. on 17 June until 10.40 a.m. on 19 June 2006 the applicant was detained in a cell for administrative offenders. He was then taken to the Sovetskiy police department. No physical force was used against him, and no complaints were made by him.",
                "20.  The investigator noted that on the two occasions the applicant had been taken to the Severnyy police department \u2013 first, for giving statements in relation to I.\u2019s disappearance, and second, for having committed the administrative offence \u2013 he had had no injuries. In the same decision the investigator suggested that the applicant\u2019s injuries could have been inflicted by a third party outside the Severnyy police department, between 17 and 19 June 2006, between one and three days before his medical examination by the forensic expert on 20 June 2006.",
                "21.  On an unspecified date the applicant also complained about the unlawful actions of officers of the Sovetskiy police department, explaining that he had blamed the officers of the Severnyy police department for all his injuries for fear of reprisals from the officers of the Sovetskiy department, in whose hands he had been at the time. An investigator of the Sovetskiy district prosecutor\u2019s office of Voronezh carried out a pre\u2011investigation inquiry and refused to institute criminal proceedings into the applicant\u2019s complaint. His decision of 10 August 2006 was annulled by his superior as unlawful and unfounded.",
                "22.  In the most recent refusal of 21 September 2006 to institute criminal proceedings for lack of evidence that a crime had been committed, the investigator found, relying on statements by the operative officers of the Sovetskiy police department, that the applicant had been taken to the station with his consent and had confessed to the murder of I. He had also shown where he had hidden her body voluntarily, without any coercion.",
                "23.  An appeal by the applicant of 17 May 2007 against the investigators\u2019 decisions was not examined by the District Court because by that time he had been convicted by a final judgment, as was stated by the court in a letter of 4 June 2007.",
                "24.  At his trial the applicant pleaded innocent and submitted that he had given the self-incriminating statements at the preliminary investigation stage as a result of physical coercion by officers of the Severnyy and Sovetskiy police departments. His counsel requested that the records of the investigative measures carried out on 19, 20 and 21 June 2006 be declared inadmissible, arguing, inter alia, that they had been obtained in the presence of lawyer P., who had been invited by investigator S. in breach of the relevant procedure and without the applicant\u2019s consent.",
                "25.  The District Court dismissed the request, noting that all investigative measures since the applicant\u2019s arrest as a suspect on 20 June 2006 had been carried out in the presence of lawyer P. Moreover, there was no evidence that the applicant had rejected her services. Following his confession, recorded in his \u201cexplanation\u201d to the investigator of 19 June 2006, the applicant had shown where he had hidden I.\u2019s body, which had not required the presence of a lawyer. The court based its findings on the self\u2011incriminating statements given by the applicant in the preliminary investigation, noting that his allegations of ill\u2011treatment in police custody had been examined and dismissed by the Sovetskiy and Kominternovskiy district prosecutor\u2019s offices in decisions of 21 and 29 September 2006 respectively.",
                "26.  On 25 October 2006 the District Court convicted the applicant of aggravated murder and sentenced him to twelve years\u2019 imprisonment.",
                "27.  On 30 November 2006 the Council of the Voronezh Regional Bar Association examined a disciplinary case against lawyer P. which originated in a complaint by the applicant. It found that P. had defended the applicant at investigator S.\u2019s direct invitation, surpassing the Council of the Voronezh Regional Bar Association in breach of the relevant procedure. P. was subjected to disciplinary liability in the form of a warning. On 5 December 2006 the Council informed the applicant of its decision, explaining that there was nothing to suggest that P. had failed to properly defend the applicant. However, it had established a breach of the procedure for providing legal assistance at the invitation of the investigating authorities.",

                "5.  The five applicants are Iraqi nationals. They now live in Switzerland, where they were granted asylum in July 2017 (see paragraph 31 below). The first and second applicants, Mr S.F. and Mrs W.O., born respectively in 1975 and 1978, are spouses. The other three applicants, Mr Y.F., Mr S.F. and Mr A.F., born respectively in 1999, 2004 and 2014, are their sons.",
                "6.  On 14 August 2015 the applicants, who had fled from Iraq, covertly crossed the Turkish-Bulgarian border. They were travelling with four other families. From there, they took taxis which drove them to the outskirts of Sofia, where they slept under the open sky for two nights. On 17 August 2015, they hired other taxis to drive them to the Bulgarian-Serbian border, somewhere around the town of Bregovo. Shortly before the border, the applicants switched cars, getting into a Toyota sports utility vehicle, which was supposed to take them through a wooded area to the border itself. They intended to cross that border covertly as well, and from there continue towards Western Europe.",
                "7.  At that time, the second applicant was three months pregnant.",
                "8.  According to media reports, over the last few years the above\u2011mentioned route has been a popular one for migrants trying to cross Bulgaria covertly on their way to Western Europe. According to a report submitted by the Government, in August 2015 the Bulgarian border police intercepted 350 adult migrants and 132 minor migrants near Bregovo and took them into custody.",
                "9.  In the late afternoon of 17 August 2015 the applicants were driven in the Toyota towards the Bulgarian-Serbian border near the village of Rabrovo, which is about fifteen kilometres south of Bregovo, twenty-five kilometres west of the town of Vidin, and about two kilometres from the border. It was also transporting the four other families; together with the applicants, it carried a total of eighteen passengers, eight of whom were minors.",
                "10.  At about 5 p.m., when the Toyota was just a few metres away from the border, two officers of the Bulgarian border police intercepted it. The driver fled. One of the officers gave chase, while the other ordered all the passengers to step out of the vehicle. The first officer could not catch up with the driver and came back. According to the applicants, he was apparently annoyed about his inability to detain the driver and hit one of the passengers. The applicants submitted that they had been afraid that he might hit them as well.",
                "11.  Half an hour later, two more officers came to the scene; subsequently, a bus, with a driver and a photographer, also arrived. According to the applicants, the officers insulted the arrestees, called them \u201cmice\u201d (the applicants did not specify in what language), and made insulting gestures. They ordered the applicants and the other passengers to get into the bus and drove them to the Bregovo Border Police Department\u2019s detention facility in Vidin. According to the applicants, the drive took about an hour. According to the Government, the drive could not have taken less than three hours. The preparation of the documents relating to the applicants\u2019 arrest then took another hour, and the written declarations that they had been acquainted with their rights were stamped as having been signed at 9 p.m. The applicants could not have therefore been placed in their cell earlier than 10 p.m.",
                "12.  Upon their arrival at the border police\u2019s detention facility in Vidin, the applicants were searched. According to them, all their effects \u2013 including travelling bags, mobile telephones, money, food, and even the fifth applicant\u2019s nappies, baby bottle and milk \u2013 were taken away from them, except for a mobile telephone belonging to the third or the fourth applicant, which they managed to conceal. According to a search report submitted by the Government, when searching the second applicant the authorities seized from her four mobile telephones, SIM cards, a USB flash drive, two digital video disks and cash. The Government also pointed out that in a video submitted by the applicants (see paragraph 15 below), travel bags and personal effects were visible inside their cell.",
                "13.  After the search, the arrestees were split into two groups. The applicants and another family were put in one cell, and the others in an adjoining one. In the application form, the applicants stated that both cells were on the detention facility\u2019s second floor.",
                "14.  According to the applicants, the cell was hot and its window could not be opened.",
                "15.  The applicants also submitted a video, which according to them had been shot with the mobile telephone that they had managed to conceal during the search (see paragraph 12 above). It shows that the cell was at ground level, about 4 by 4 metres, with a large double window (secured on the inside by a mesh grille), an open door, and a padlocked metal grille on the door. In the video the cell looks run-down, with dilapidated walls, paint coming off the ceiling in flakes, and a dirty floor partly covered with dirty (and in places damp) cardboard sheets. The furniture consists of two old and dilapidated bunk beds and a single bed, with four or five bare soiled mattresses. Two of the mattresses are on the floor, one is on the single bed, and one is on the bottom bunk of one of the bunk beds. A single crumpled\u2011up bed sheet lies on one of the mattresses on the floor. Personal effects, such as a small shoulder bag, training shoes and some litter, are strewn about. Other random objects \u2013 food remains, empty plastic bottles, rubbish and a torn blanket \u2013 are piled up in a corner. The third and fourth applicants can be seen sitting on one of the bunk beds, whereas the fifth applicant (the toddler) can at first be seen sitting on the floor beside the door and then being picked up and carried around by the first applicant. Apart from the five applicants, three other people can be seen in the cell: a middle\u2011aged woman lying on the single bed, a boy (perhaps two or three years old), and the man shooting the video.",
                "16.  The video was submitted by the applicants on a digital video disk containing two video files. One is in .mpg format and bears a time stamp according to which it was last modified at 5.36 p.m. on 17 September \u200e2015; and the other is in .mp4 format and bears a time stamp according to which it was last modified at 3.27 p.m. on 15 December 2015. The footage in both files is identical, except that: (a) the faces of the applicants in the first one have been pixelated (whereas in the second they have not); (b) the running time of the first video is one minute and twenty-one seconds (whereas that of the second is one minute and thirty-two seconds, as it continues for another ten seconds); and (c) in the first file the footage is horizontal whereas in the second it is rotated to the right at a ninety-degree angle. The footage in the first file has a definition of 1,280 by 720 pixels and is at twenty-four frames per second, whereas that in the second file has a definition of 1,920 by 1,080 pixels and is at twenty-nine frames per second.",
                "17.  The applicants explained that the above-mentioned dates and times corresponded with when they had copied the video files in Switzerland, and that they had in fact recorded the original video on 18 August 2015, at about noon. Since they had taken the SIM cards out of the mobile telephone several times in the course of their journey and then re-inserted them, the telephone had not indicated the correct time and date, making it impossible to pinpoint the exact date and time when the video had been recorded.",
                "18.  In a letter to the Government Agent, an official from the Migration Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Sofia, having compared the video footage with the photographs in the applicants\u2019 migration files, stated that he could confirm that the applicants were indeed the people featured in the video.",
                "19.  According to the Government, the border police\u2019s detention facility in Vidin was equipped in accordance with the relevant regulations. They did not provide further details in that respect.",
                "20.  According to the applicants, after being put in the cell, they were not given anything to eat or drink, or allowed to go to the toilet. Since there was no toilet or a bucket in the cell, they had to urinate onto the floor. The Government did not comment on that point.",
                "21.  About four hours later, at about 10 p.m., officers came and took the first applicant to another building in order to take his picture and to digitally fingerprint him. After that, the officers took out the second applicant for fingerprinting. After the fingerprinting procedure, the officers left the applicants in the cell for the night.",
                "22.  Between 10.30 a.m. and 11 a.m. and between 11 a.m. and 11.30 a.m. the next day, 18 August 2015, a border police investigator interviewed respectively the first and the second applicants. The interviews were conducted in English and translated into Bulgarian with the help of an interpreter.",
                "23.  According to the applicants, after the interview the second applicant asked the guards to give her back her bag, so that she could prepare a baby bottle for her toddler (the fifth applicant), and the guards did so. The Government did not comment on that point.",
                "24.  After that, the guards took the applicants one by one out of the cell to go to the toilet.",
                "25.  According to the applicants, later that day, a ten-month-old child in the adjoining cell touched an electrical wire and suffered an electric shock. That caused panic among the detainees, and the guards allowed all of them out of their cells. An ambulance was called. When hearing that the applicants had not had anything to eat or drink since their arrest, the nurse who came with the ambulance argued with the guards and took the second applicant and her youngest child, the fifth applicant, to a hospital in Vidin, where the second applicant was examined by a gynaecologist between 8.05 p.m. and 8.35 p.m., and the fifth applicant was examined by a paediatrician between 8.20 p.m. and 8.40 p.m. Two or three hours later they were taken back to the detention facility.",
                "26.  According to the applicants, at that point the guards told them that they would give them food if they paid for it; the guards then took money from their bags and gave them two loaves of bread, a yoghurt, four bottles of Coca-Cola, one kilogram of tomatoes, one kilogram of cucumbers, one kilogram of bananas, and a small piece of pat\u00e9. According to the Government, the applicants were provided with food and water, in accordance with the relevant regulations. In support of their assertion, the Government submitted a table setting out the prescribed daily rations for adult and minor detained migrants and a report, drawn up by the head of the Bregovo Border Police Department on 1 September 2015, which listed the names of all migrants \u2013 including the applicants \u2013 which had been detained in the Department\u2019s detention facility in Vidin during the month of August 2015 and provided with food there.",
                "27.  Then, at about 10 p.m. or 11 p.m., the applicants were put back in the cell. According to them, they were allowed to go to the toilet before that, but had not been able to do so during the night. The Government did not comment on that point.",
                "28.  The next day, 19 August 2015, the applicants were served with orders for the first and second applicants\u2019 removal from Bulgaria and for their detention pending removal, all issued the previous day. It does not appear that separate orders were issued with respect to the third, fourth and fifth applicants, who were mentioned as accompanied minors in the orders for the first and second applicants\u2019 detention (see paragraph 33 below).",
                "29.  According to the applicants, at about midday on 19 August 2015 they were given back their belongings and driven to an immigration detention facility in Sofia. According to the Government, that happened much earlier that day, at about 6 a.m. or 7 a.m., since the relevant records showed that the applicants had been placed in the detention facility in Sofia at 2.45 p.m., and the normal travel time between the two facilities was about six or seven hours.",
                "30.  On 24 August 2015 the applicants sought international protection in Bulgaria. Their applications were registered by the State Agency for Refugees on 31 August 2015, and they were released from the immigration detention facility in Sofia and settled in an open facility for the accommodation of asylum-seekers. On 23 September 2015 those proceedings were, however, discontinued because the applicants had vanished from the facility.",
                "31.  In the meantime, the applicants made their way to Switzerland, where they likewise sought international protection on 8 September 2015. On 8 January 2016 the Swiss authorities decided not to examine their applications but rather to transfer them back to Bulgaria under Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third\u2011country national or a stateless person (\u201cthe Dublin III Regulation\u201d), which also applies to Switzerland (see A.S. v. Switzerland, no. 39350/13, \u00a7\u00a7 12-13, 30 June 2015). Following legal challenges by the applicants, on 7 July 2016 the Swiss authorities varied their own decision and proceeded with the examination of the applications. Just over a year later, on 27 July 2017, the applicants were granted asylum in Switzerland."

                "8.  The application concerns proceedings for extradition from Austria to Kosovo, which have the following background:",
                "9.  S.Lu. is the former husband of the applicant\u2019s sister, T.L. In the course of an argument on 9 October 2001, S.Lu. stabbed the applicant in the chest. On 27 May 2002 S.Lu. was convicted in Austria of attempted intentional homicide (versuchter Totschlag) committed in a comprehensible state of emotion (in einer allgemein begreiflichen heftigen Gem\u00fctsbewegung) under Articles 15 and 76 of the Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch) and sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment. The applicant testified as a witness during that trial.",
                "10.  After S.Lu. was released from prison in 2005, the applicant\u2019s sister reported him to the police for having repeatedly raped her during their marriage, and for threatening to kill her and her family. Out of fear of her husband, she changed her and her children\u2019s names. An order to determine S.Lu.\u2019s whereabouts (Ausschreibung zur Aufenthaltsbestimmung) was issued by the Vienna public prosecutor\u2019s office in 2008 and is in effect until 2 February 2018.",
                "11.  On the basis of an international arrest warrant issued by the Mitrovica District Court (Kosovo) on 26 November 2010 and 6 May 2011, the applicant was apprehended and taken into detention pending extradition by a decision of the Vienna Regional Criminal Court (Straflandesgericht Wien \u2013 hereinafter \u201cthe Criminal Court\u201d) of 15 January 2016. On 20 January 2016 the Ministry of Justice of Kosovo requested the applicant\u2019s extradition. According to the arrest warrant, the applicant was suspected of aggravated murder under Article 147 \u00a7 7 in conjunction with Article 24 of the Kosovo Criminal Code. He had allegedly ordered L.Q. in July 2010 to murder S.Lu. (his former brother-in-law) for a payment of 30,000 euros (EUR). On 3 August 2010 L.Q. fired gunshots at a car in the vicinity of the intended victim S.Lu., but instead killed N.Lu., S.Lu.\u2019s cousin.",
                "12.  During the extradition proceedings, the applicant alleged that he had nothing to do with the murder in Kosovo. He claimed that the accusations had been invented by S.Lu. as revenge for the applicant\u2019s having testified against him during the criminal proceedings in Austria. Furthermore, the \u201cLu. clan\u201d (the family of S.Lu.) was very influential in Kosovo and had connections to the highest Government officials and the justice authorities there, which is why the applicant could not expect a fair trial in that jurisdiction. In addition, the conditions of detention in Kosovo prisons were deplorable and would amount to torture, inhuman and degrading treatment. Because of the threat emanating from S.Lu. and his family, the applicant would have to fear for his life there. They could easily get to him in prison by using their connections.",
                "13.  On 24 February 2016, after having held an oral hearing, the Criminal Court declared the applicant\u2019s extradition to Kosovo permissible. It held that during the extradition proceedings, the court was not called on to examine whether the applicant was guilty or innocent, but merely to assess whether there was enough evidence to raise suspicions against him, which according to the documents submitted by the Kosovo authorities was the case. None of the evidence offered by the applicant had been capable of dispelling these suspicions immediately and without doubt, as would have been required by section 33(2) of the Extradition and Legal Aid Act (Auslieferungs- und Rechtshilfegesetz \u2013 hereinafter \u201cthe Extradition Act\u201d). The fact that S.Lu. had been convicted of attempted intentional homicide in 2002 and the allegation that he wanted to take revenge on the applicant did not dispell the suspicion either. Furthermore, the court remarked that S.Lu.\u2019s cousin had actually been killed, which called into question the applicant\u2019s theory of that being a contrived story. It could equally be argued that the applicant had wanted to take revenge on S.Lu. for stabbing him. Concerning the applicant\u2019s fear for his life in Kosovo, the court stated that the mere possibility of inhuman or degrading treatment did not suffice. The applicant had failed to adduce specific evidence of an actual, individual threat of treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention. Furthermore, in case of extradition to a member state of the Convention, the responsibility of the extraditing state was limited, as the person concerned could seek protection against a violation of the Convention in the receiving state.",
                "14.  On 24 March 2016 the applicant appealed. He submitted that if extradited to Kosovo, he risked treatment contrary to Article 3, because Lu. Clan wished to take revenge on him. In fact, Sm. Lu., a very influential member of that clan, was detained at Mitrovica prison and following extradition to Kosovo, he would be detained at that prison as well. Security in prison in Kosovo was a problem, as prisoners became frequently victims of aggression, and he would therefore also risk to become the victim of an assault.",
                "15.  On 31 May 2016 the Vienna Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht Wien \u2011 hereinafter \u201cthe Court of Appeal\u201d) dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal. It confirmed the Criminal Court\u2019s finding that the applicant had failed to substantiate a real and individual risk of being subjected to torture, inhuman or degrading treatment, or that the Kosovo authorities would not be able to protect him from third, private parties. Furthermore, members of the allegedly influential Lu. clan were themselves imprisoned in Kosovo. In particular, on 21 January 2008 S.Lu. was convicted in Kosovo for issuing a dangerous threat against the applicant, which demonstrated that the Kosovo authorities were indeed capable of taking adequate measures to protect the applicant. Moreover, the Lu. clan could not be that influential if it was not capable of keeping its own members out of prison. Concerning the conditions of detention, the court held that the report on Kosovo by the Committee for the Prevention of Torture (hereinafter \u201cthe CPT\u201d) of 2011 (see paragraph 30 below) did not state that ill-treatment was the rule in Kosovo prisons, but that there were merely sporadic incidents of violence. The mere possibility of ill-treatment by prison officers did not suffice to stop the applicant\u2019s extradition. In relation to the material conditions of detention in Mitrovica Detention Centre, where the applicant alleged he would most likely be held if extradited, the Court of Appeal again quoted the above-mentioned CPT report of 2011, where it was found that inmates were able to move freely within that facility during the day and could exercise outside on a daily basis for three and a half hours, and that fitness and computer rooms have recently been installed.",
                "16.  On 13 June 2016 the Austrian Federal Minister of Justice (Justizminister) approved the applicant\u2019s extradition to Kosovo.",
                "17.  On 20 June 2016 the applicant requested that the Court indicate to the Austrian Government to stay his extradition to Kosovo under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court. He complained under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention that he would run the risk of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or even death, as the Lu. clan wanted to take revenge on him and the Kosovo authorities were not willing or able to afford him protection.",
                "18.  On 22 June 2016 the Court granted the applicant\u2019s request.",
                "19.  On 17 June 2016 the applicant lodged applications for the reopening (Wiederaufnahme) of the extradition proceedings and a stay of the extradition with the Criminal Court. He produced a certified declaration by L.Q., who had retracted his previous confession to the police that the applicant had ordered the murder of S.Lu. He asserted that he had been tortured by the Kosovo police during his questioning and had been pressured into blaming the applicant for ordering the murder. L.Q. alleged that he had fallen unconscious several times because of the \u201cmental and physical torture\u201d. L.Q. averred that he did not even know the applicant in person. The applicant further submitted into evidence several sworn statements from family members and friends, who attested that his life was in danger in Kosovo because of threats from S.Lu. and his clan.",
                "20.  On 23 June 2016 the Criminal Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s applications. It held that in accordance with section 33(2) of the Extradition Act, the applicant had failed to adduce evidence which would have been capable of immediately dispelling the suspicion against him raised in the extradition request. L.Q.\u2019s declaration did not constitute objective evidence and did not indicate any violations in Kosovo of the applicant\u2019s rights under the Convention either. The applicant appealed.",
                "21.  On 18 July 2016 the applicant lodged an application for a renewal (Erneuerung) of the extradition proceedings with the Supreme Court under Article 363a of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Strafprozessordnung \u2013 hereinafter \u201cthe CCP\u201d), requesting suspensive effect at the same time.",
                "22.  On 6 September 2016 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant\u2019s application. It found that the new evidence the applicant had produced in the proceedings before it were a matter for the pending reopening proceedings, not for requesting a renewal of the extradition proceedings. In relation to the alleged violations of Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention in the event of his extradition, the Supreme Court found that mere allegations referencing general reports on the human rights situation were not capable of substantiating a real and immediate risk to the applicant under these provisions. Furthermore, the Supreme Court held that the applicant did not have a right under the law to request suspensive effect, which is why that request had to be rejected.",
                "23.  On 24 January 2017 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal against the Criminal Court\u2019s decision of 23 June 2016 (see paragraph 20 above). The court found that the applicant had failed to produce objective evidence which would have indicated a real and immediate risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention if extradited to Kosovo and therefore would have warranted a reopening of the extradition proceedings. While the sworn statement by L.Q. in principle raised doubts in relation to the suspicions against the applicant, it had not constituted the only evidence against him. More pertinent had been the fact that, during the criminal proceedings against L.Q. in Kosovo, a microcassette had been put into evidence by S.Lu. which had allegedly contained a conversation confirming his statements that the applicant had been to blame for the murder. In addition, L.Q.\u2019s initial incriminating statements against the applicant had been made in the presence of his lawyer. Moreover, L.Q. had not specified what exactly the police had allegedly done to him, which had made it impossible to evaluate whether the alleged treatment had actually amounted to torture, inhuman or degrading treatment. The Court of Appeal reiterated that it was in any event for the Kosovo courts to evaluate the evidence against the applicant. In sum, it confirmed that the statement by L.Q. was not capable of immediately dispelling the suspicion against the applicant on which the extradition request was based. Lastly, the Court of Appeal found that despite not being a State Party to the Convention or the Council of Europe, Article 22 of the Constitution of Kosovo granted the Convention direct effect under and superiority to national law, therefore domestic law equally offered protection from violations of the Convention. The Court of Appeal\u2019s decision to dismiss the applicant\u2019s appeal was served on his counsel on 30 January 2017."

On 3 December 2014 the U.S. Embassy issued a note verbale, which provided the following answer:\n\u201cThe United States notes that the bilateral extradition treaty between the United States and Spain does not provide a basis for conditioning extraditions on assurances relating to life sentences. While the United States is not, therefore, obligated to provide the assurance requested, in consideration of the request of the Spanish Court and given the intentions of the U.S. prosecutor, the United States is prepared in this particular case to inform the Government of Spain as follows: Should LOPEZ ELORZA be convicted of either of the charges in the indictment filed on 15 November 2005 for which extradition is sought, he will not be subject to an unalterable sentence of life imprisonment because, if a life sentence is imposed, he may seek review of his sentence on appeal and he may subsequently seek relief from his sentence in the form of a petition for a pardon or commutation to a lesser sentence ...\u201d",

                "19.  The applicant brought two s\u00faplica appeals against that decision, the first of which was lodged on 28 February 2015. The applicant argued that the decision of 24 February 2015 should be declared null and void since the matter should have been addressed through an auto, instead of a providencia[1]. Secondly, the applicant contested the argument that the US Government had provided sufficient guarantees, stating that they were identical to the ones that had already been analysed by the Court in the case of Trabelsi v. Belgium (no. 140/10, ECHR 2014 (extracts)) and found to be in violation of Article 3 (inter alia). The second s\u00faplica appeal was lodged on 2 March 2015 and included three different requests. First, he requested that the decision on whether the US guarantees were sufficient be addressed and dealt with by the Plenary of the Audiencia Nacional. He also sought the recusal of three judges who were members of the bench which had initially issued the decision of 24 February 2015. Lastly, he lodged an application for the general recusal of all the judges of the Audiencia Nacional who \u201chad been invited by the United States of America on holiday trips\u201d which had been paid for by that country.",
                "20.  On 25 March 2015 the Audiencia Nacional issued a decision stating the following:\n\u201cFIRST - We will examine in the first place the plea for a referral to the Plenary formation of this Court of the decision about the sufficiency of the assurances given by the U.S. Government concerning the possibility for two life sentences to be imposed on the extradited person. This Chamber, given that the President of this Court has duly empowered it to decide about this matter, considers that the referral is not necessary as the assurances given are correct and sufficient, and furthermore show compliance with the ECtHR case-law in the Trabelsi vs Belgium case referred to by the appellant ....\nTherefore, if the assurances given by the U.S. Government are the following:\n\u201cShould LOPEZ ELORZA be convicted of either of the charges in the indictment filed on 15 November 2005, he will not be subject to an unalterable sentence of life imprisonment, he may seek review of his sentence on appeal and he may subsequently seek relief from his sentence in the form of a petition for a pardon or commutation to a lesser sentence;\u201d\nwe can conclude that the warranty expresses the actual existing legal means for the revision of a sentence of life imprisonment in a way that shows that this punishment is not irreducible during the whole life-span of the person, complying with what the ECtHR has requested in order to consider that there has been no violation of Article 3 of the Convention.\nThat is why there is no need to refer a decision on this matter to the Plenary formation of this Court.\u201d",
                "21.  Additionally, the Audiencia Nacional agreed on opening a procedure aimed at addressing the issue of the recusals requested by the applicant through a full report, at the same time ordering the suspension of the extradition proceedings until the recusal proceedings had been terminated.",

                "24.  In a decision of 28 May 2015 the Audiencia Nacional rejected the applicant\u2019s request to stay the extradition proceedings, finding that the complaints contained in the first s\u00faplica appeal had already been dealt with in the decision of 25 March 2015.",
                "25.  On 1 June 2015 the applicant lodged another s\u00faplica appeal against the decisions of 25 May 2015 and 28 May 2015, contesting the reasoning as regards his request to stay the extradition proceedings and emphasising that no decision had been taken on the issues complained of in the first s\u00faplica appeal of 28 February 2015.",
                "26.  On 3 June 2015 the Audiencia Nacional issued a new decision dismissing the s\u00faplica appeals lodged by the applicant and confirming the decision on the applicant\u2019s imprisonment pending extradition to the United States. In particular, the decision stated the following:\n\u201cThe applicant considers that his s\u00faplica appeal lodged against the decision of 24 February 2015 has not been answered ... .\nThis Court refers at this point to what was already established in its decision of 25 March 2015 ... .\nNevertheless, in order to clarify any doubts that the applicant might have concerning whether or not he has received an answer to his s\u00faplica appeal, we [the Court] will resolve here the issued raised in that appeal.\n...\nThe guarantees provided have been considered sufficient for the Court. Consequently, regardless of the judgment mentioned by the applicant, we consider that they comply with the requirements established in the ECtHR\u2019s judgment Hutchinson v. United Kingdom [(no. 57592/08, 3 February 2015)], as well as the judgment of 13 November 2014 [Bodein v. France, no. 40014/10, 13 November 2014)], lodged by a French citizen...\nTaking into consideration the above-mentioned reasoning, the Court\nDecides\nto dismiss the s\u00faplica appeals referred to in the present ruling, maintaining the order of imprisonment for Andr\u00e9s L\u00f3pez Elorza, in view of his extradition to the United States of America\u201d.",
                "27.  On 19 June 2015 the applicant was detained for the purposes of being extradited to the United States.",
                "28.  On 22 June 2015 the applicant lodged an amparo appeal with the Constitutional Court against the extradition decision. He asked for interim measures, requesting the Constitutional Court to order a stay of the extradition while the case was still pending. He contended, inter alia, that the assurances provided by the US authorities did not fulfil the criteria for assessing the reducibility of a life sentence and that the extradition would amount to a violation of his right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.",
                "29.  On 1 July 2015 the Constitutional Court issued a decision declaring the amparo appeal and the request for interim measures inadmissible. In particular, it found that the part of the amparo appeal concerning the validity of the assurances given by the US authorities and about a possible violation of the applicant\u2019s right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment had been lodged too late as the alleged violations stemmed from the decision of 25 March 2015, thus the 30-day time\u2011limit established in section 44(2) of the Organic Law on the Constitutional Court No. 2/1919 had already passed when he had lodged his amparo appeal.",
                "30.  On 2 July 2015 the applicant lodged a request for interim measures with the Court under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court. He requested the Court to indicate to the Spanish Government that his extradition should be stayed pending the outcome of proceedings before the Court. The request was granted on the same day on a temporary basis until 1 August 2015, and the Government were asked the following questions:\n\u201ca.- Does the applicant risk under US criminal law, in respect of the charges, a maximum penalty that precludes early release and/or release on parole?\nb.- What are the concrete mechanisms and under what US legal basis is the applicant entitled to review his possible final life sentence? In this sense, are the appeal, pardon and other review mechanisms referred to in the note verbale of 3 December 2014 the ones described in the case of Trabelsi v. Belgium (application no. 140/10, 4 September 2014, \u00a7 27)?\u201d",
                "31.  On 23 July 2015 the Government submitted their response and attached a document issued by the Office of International Affairs of the US Department of Justice called \u201csupplemental information to Spain on Sentencing Issues in Relation to Andres Lopez Elorza, a/k/a \u2018Andres Lopez Flores\u2019 (hereinafter, \u201cthe US report\u201d). The report stated the following:\n\u201cBy way of introduction, Lopez Elorza\u2019s extradition is sought in order for him to stand trial on federal narcotics offenses in the Eastern District of New York. In essence, Lopez Elorza, a veterinarian, is charged with having been a member of a conspiracy between September 2004 and January 2005, the goal of which was to import heroin into the United States for subsequent distribution, in which Lopez Elorza\u2019s role was to surgically implant packages of liquid heroin into the bodies of dogs that later were transported to the United States. The charges followed the search, in January 2005, of a farm Lopez Elorza operated in Medellin, Colombia, in which law enforcement authorities seized six puppies into which three kilograms of liquid heroin had been surgically implanted. The six puppies were bound for the United States, and the heroin they carried was surgically removed. After the search of his farm, Lopez Elorza fled Colombia.\u201d",
                "32.  As regards the first question put to the Government, the US report argued that there were pretrial factors that could affect the applicant\u2019s sentencing. In particular, the report noted the following:\n\u201cBefore any trial, Lopez Elorza could, with the advice of his lawyer, decide to give up the right to a trial and plead guilty to the charges in the indictment, with or without the agreement of the prosecution. See Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(a). A timely admission of guilt is a factor which could reduce the sentence the judge decides to impose following a conviction. In the United States, the vast majority of criminal cases are resolved by guilty pleas. Lopez Elorza may seek to reach an agreement with the prosecution wherein he would plead guilty in exchange for certain favorable actions, such as an agreement to allow him to plead guilty to fewer than all the charges in the indictment (with the remainder of the charges to be dismissed at sentencing), or even to lesser charges, or in exchange for the government\u2019s promise to affirmatively recommend to the court that a particular lesser sentence be imposed. The agreement may also include the parties\u2019 recommendation as to the appropriate sentence that - depending upon the type of plea agreement that is negotiated - may or may not bind the judge regarding the sentence that will be imposed. Such agreements are within the discretion of the government to enter into, and the judge may also decline to approve an agreement she or he does not believe to be in the interests of justice. The agreement may include, inter alia, an agreement to cooperate with U.S. authorities. Thus, if Lopez Elorza were willing and able to provide substantial assistance to the United States in the investigation or prosecution of another person who had committed a crime, a plea agreement might include a promise by the government attorneys, in exchange for his guilty plea, to file a motion with the court asking that Lopez Elorza\u2019s cooperation be taken into account and permitting the Court to impose a lower sentence that it might otherwise impose. Title 18, United States Code, Section 3553(e); United States Sentencing Guidelines, Section 5K1.1. In such cases, it is not atypical for a judge to impose a sentence that is significantly less than the Guidelines recommendation.\u201d",
                "33.  It also observed that \u201c[i]f, however, Lopez Elorza decides not to plead guilty and instead exercise his right to a trial, and if he is found guilty of one or more charges, his sentencing exposure will vary, depending on the nature of the charges on which he is found guilty. Moreover, the judge will have broad discretion to determine the appropriate sentence [...]\u201d.",
                "34.  As regards the estimated sentence that the applicant could face, the US report stated firstly that, \u201cIn imposing a sentence in a federal criminal case, the judge must consult the U.S. Federal Sentencing Guidelines\u201d. It added that the Guidelines were advisory since the judge had \u201cthe discretion to impose a sentence outside the applicable Guidelines range so long as the court states \u2018with specificity,\u2019 both at sentencing and in the written judgment and commitment order, its reason for doing so\u201d. It additionally stated that, \u201c[b]oth the defendant and the government have the statutory right to appeal any sentence imposed on the grounds that it is substantively or procedurally unreasonable under the circumstances of the case\u201d. Moreover, the decision whether to sentence a person convicted of multiple counts concurrently or consecutively was at the discretion of the court. Section 3584 of Title 18 of the US Code, states, in part, that \u201c[m]ultiple terms of imprisonment imposed at the same time run concurrently unless the court orders or the statute mandates that the terms are to run consecutively\u201d. The report further stressed the following:\n\u201cPrior to sentencing, a probation officer will prepare a presentence report that contains information about the defendant\u2019s offense, his criminal history, other background information, and a calculation of the advisory sentencing range under the Sentencing Guidelines. The defendant has the right to object to the information and conclusion in the present report. Later, during the sentencing phase of the proceedings, defense counsel will be able to present to the judge various mitigating factors to consider that may result in the reduction of his sentence. Specifically, under Title 18, United States Code, Section 3553(a), in determining the particular sentence imposed on a defendant, the court shall consider: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to promote respect for the law, punishment for the offense, deter the defendant or others from committing similar criminal conduct, and the need to protect the public; (3) the kinds of sentences available; (4) the applicable guideline range; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment; (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities; and (7) the need to provide restitution to the victims of the offense(s). In assisting the court in considering the above seven factors, defense counsel will be able to present to the court in detail any mitigating factors relating to these criteria. This would enable the defense to provide to the sentencing court information regarding Lopez Elorza\u2019s background and circumstances, including: his family environment and relationships, the environment in which he was raised, his work history,... socioeconomic factors including educational opportunities or lack thereof, his physical and psychological well-being and any past or current treatment, prior criminal conduct, if any, and any resultant rehabilitative programs and periods of probation, incarceration, and parole, as well as Lopez Elorza\u2019s longterm educational, vocational, and sociological goals\u201d.",
                "35.  The report noted that there were many factors that contributed to the imposition of a sentence and that it was \u201cimpossible to address every conceivable permutation that could occur or every possible scenario that might arise\u201d. However, the report indicated that according to the US Federal Sentencing Guidelines, the advisory sentencing range was \u201c188 to 235 months incarceration, far less than the possible life sentence provided for under the statutes with which he was charged\u201d.",
                "36.  Furthermore, the report stated that under section 3553(a) of Title 18 of the US Code, there was a \u201cneed to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities\u201d. In that regard, the report stated that several of the applicant\u2019s co-conspirators had already been sentenced in a related case before the same judge who had been assigned to the applicant\u2019s case. One of the co-conspirators \u201cfaced a Guidelines range of 188 to 235 months and received a sentence of 72 months incarceration\u201d, another \u201cfaced a Guidelines range of 78 to 87 months and received a sentence of 14 months incarceration\u201d and a third had \u201cfaced a Guidelines range of 70 to 87 months and received a sentence of Time Served (approximately 12 months incarceration)\u201d. The US report also noted that none of those defendants had entered into cooperation agreements with the government. Consequently, the sentences imposed on the applicant\u2019s co-conspirators by the same judge who had been assigned to the applicant\u2019s case \u201c[could] be of value in assessing the sentence that will be imposed on him\u201d.",
                "37.  The report concluded that while it was possible that any available maximum sentence could be imposed for an offence, under the circumstances present in this case, \u201cthe risk of L\u00f3pez Elorza receiving such a sentence is low\u201d.",
                "38.  As regards the second question, the US report stated that if the applicant was sentenced to a life term, he could benefit from a variety of mechanisms to seek to have the sentence invalidated or reduced or to obtain early release.",
                "39.  Concerning the applicant\u2019s right to invalidate or reduce his sentence, the Government stated that the applicant would have the right under US law to lodge an appeal with the Court of Appeals, asking for a reversal of his conviction \u201cbased on an error in the proceedings\u201d. The applicant would also be able to \u201cask the Court of Appeals to review the appropriateness of his sentence\u201d. He could argue that a life sentence was \u201cunreasonable\u201d in the circumstances of his case. The report also stated that even after the applicant had exhausted his rights at trial and on appeal, he could under US law file \u201ca motion in the trial court claiming that his life sentence was imposed \u2018in violation of the Constitution or the laws of the United States\u2019, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack\u201d.",
                "40.  Concerning the applicant\u2019s right to obtain early release, the report specifically stated that \u201csince 1987, there has been no federal parole system in the United States\u201d. The applicant, however, could ask for early release if he provided substantial assistance after his conviction and the imposition of his sentence. In addition, US law also allowed for compassionate release under section 3582 of Title 18 of the US Code. The report specifically stressed that the Bureau of Prisons could reduce the applicant\u2019s sentence if it found that there was \u201can extraordinary and compelling reason to do so; for example, if a medical condition arose with L\u00f3pez Elorza that would warrant such a modification\u201d. Finally, the applicant could also seek executive clemency in the form of commutation (reduction) of his sentence. The report noted that in cases similar to the applicant\u2019s, commutation of life sentences was not \u201ca rare occurrence\u201d. It gave as an example that of 13 July 2015, when President Obama had commuted the life sentences of \u201cfourteen persons who had been convicted of drug related offenses\u201d.",
                "41.  On 31 July 2015 the interim measures under Rule 39 were extended and the Court requested that the Government stay the applicant\u2019s extradition to the United States while the proceedings were pending before the Court."

                "6.  The applicant, at the relevant time a judge of the Radomyshl District Court (\u201cthe District Court\u201d), was convicted of abuse of office for having exploited a certain Mr I. as a worker on the renovation of his father\u2019s house under the following circumstances. In April 2007 the applicant, having sentenced I. to fifteen days\u2019 imprisonment for disorderly conduct, had the site manager for the house renovation, Mr Sh., check I. out of the police detention facility (\u201cthe facility\u201d) where the latter was serving his sentence and take him to the construction site where he was to work under Sh.\u2019s direction. Then, in November 2007, a police officer, G., conspired with the applicant in drawing up a report falsely accusing I. of another episode of disorderly conduct. G. fabricated written statements by false witnesses, P.S. and I.A., incriminating I., and submitted the file to the applicant. Knowing that I. was innocent and the report was false, the applicant convicted I. and sentenced him to another fifteen days\u2019 detention. The same scheme was used to exploit I. on the construction site.",

According to the transcript of his statement dated 23 January 2008, which was also video-recorded, Sh. stated that the applicant had employed him to work on his father\u2019s house, that in April 2007 I. had worked on the site on terms he had negotiated with the applicant and that in November I. had worked while serving his fifteen-day sentence. The applicant had instructed Sh. to collect I. from the detention facility, so he had done so. The statement was signed by Sh. on the first and second pages, where his rights as a witness were explained. The statement consists of three more type-written pages containing the transcript of the interview but is not signed by Sh. at the end. It contains a note by the investigator to the effect that Sh. did not sign because he failed to appear when summoned by the investigator. The file contains a report of the same date, signed by Sh., to the effect that he had watched the video recording of his interview and had no comment to make.",
                "9.  On 23 January 2008 I. was interviewed by the investigator. He stated that around May (sic) 2007 he had been sentenced to fifteen days\u2019 imprisonment for disobeying the orders of a police officer. While serving his sentence he had worked on the construction of a house belonging to the applicant, under the direction of Sh. After his release, he had agreed to work for the applicant in return for payment and had carried out construction work for him in June and October 2007. He had then stopped working for the applicant. On 8 November 2007 he had been taken from his home by police officers, who had told him that the applicant had accused him of stealing some cables from the building site. He had been taken to the office of the applicant, who had told him that since he refused to work for money, he would have to work for free. As he had refused to work for free, the applicant had responded that then he would rot in a cell, and had given him a fifteen-day sentence. While he had been serving his sentence, Sh. had taken him out of the detention facility several times and he had worked on the applicant\u2019s construction site: he had refused to build a fence and had done some other work on the site. He had not been remunerated. The applicant had visited the site once and had seen him working but they had not spoken.",
                "10.  On 12 September 2008 I. made a notarised statement to the effect that his statement incriminating the applicant had been given \u201cunder the influence of psychological violence and trickery\u201d (\u0437 \u0437\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f\u043c \u0449\u043e\u0434\u043e \u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0441\u0438\u0445\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0456\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0442\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0443) and that in fact he had worked willingly and for remuneration.",
                "11.  On 30 September 2008 I. was again interviewed by the investigator. The interview was video-recorded. He largely confirmed the tenor of his statement of 23 January 2008 and denied knowingly signing the notarised statement repudiating it. In addition to repeating various elements of his statement of 23 January 2008, he said that although the house where he had worked formally belonged to the applicant\u2019s father, it was the applicant himself who had organised the work. He stressed that he had not been remunerated for his work in April and November 2007 and had not worked voluntarily. In September 2008 the applicant had made him visit a notarial office to formalise some papers, the nature of which he was not clear about.",
                "12.  The applicant and his co-defendant, former police officer G., stood trial before the Vinnytsya Regional Court of Appeal, which was acting as the trial court.",
                "13.  The applicant testified that he had had no connection to his father\u2019s house or work on it. He had not requested that I. be sent there. When convicting I., he had not been aware that the charges against him had been false. I. had worked voluntarily and for remuneration. The applicant did not deny that Sh. had been the construction site manager on the renovation of his father\u2019s house but argued that it had been his father who had been concerned by those works and that the applicant himself had had minimal contact with Sh. The phone number which the prosecution argued he had used to contact Sh. in fact belonged not to him but to his father.",
                "14.  G. admitted that he had forged the administrative arrest report in respect of I. but stated that he had done it at the request of officers B. and S. (see paragraphs 15 and 16 below). He said that the applicant had not been involved and had been unaware of the forgery when convicting I.",
                "15.  B., the head of the detention facility, testified that in late October or early November 2007 the applicant had told him that I. had stolen some things from his construction site and had asked B. to bring I. to him. On 8 November 2007 he had taken I. from his home to the police station. He denied having instructed G. to forge documents in I.\u2019s case. On 12 November 2007 B. was informed by another officer that a stranger claiming to be a court officer showed up at the station and was asking for prisoners to perform works at the court. This was refused. Sometime afterwards the applicant called the station to discuss the release of prisoners and spoke to the commanding officer of the station who gave permission for release of prisoners.",
                "16.  S., an officer on duty at the police station, testified that I. had on several occasions been handed over to a person introduced as an employee of the District Court, supposedly for work at the court. On 21 November 2007 the applicant had called personally and asked that I. be handed over for such work. The applicant contested the way S.\u2019s testimony was recorded in the domestic court\u2019s judgment and asserted that S. had not identified him by name. It appears that S. also denied having given any unlawful instructions to G. concerning I.\u2019s case.",
                "17.  Other police officers testified that Sh. had checked I. out of the facility on several occasions.",
                "18.  P., a District Court officer, stated that he was in charge of taking prisoners from the police detention facility to the District Court to carry out work, and that he knew I. well. However, in November 2007 the latter had not worked at the court.",
                "19.  The applicant\u2019s father confirmed that he had bought the house and had had Sh. perform renovation works on it. He denied knowing I.",
                "20.  On 3 July 2009 the trial court, noting that I. had failed to appear despite the fact that summonses had been duly sent to him, ordered the police to escort I. to the next court hearing on 10 July 2009.",
                "21.  On 8 July 2009 the police reported that I. could not be found at his last known address in Radomyshl and that his whereabouts were unknown. His mother, niece and another neighbour had informed the police that I. had not been living at his usual address in Radomyshl for some time, having left to work in Kyiv. Although he visited briefly from time to time, they had no way of contacting him.",
                "22.  On 24 July 2009 the trial court asked the Zhytomyr regional prosecutor to establish the whereabouts of I. and Sh., and to escort them to the hearing scheduled for 17 September 2009. The prosecutor in turn asked the Security Service for assistance in establishing the whereabouts of those two individuals. On 4 September 2009 the Security Service reported essentially the same information as gathered by the police on 8 July 2009. They also stated that Sh. was not living at his address and his whereabouts were unknown.",
                "23.  On 17 September 2009 the trial court again ordered that the police bring I. to the next court hearing on 29 September 2009. The police could not locate I. at his last known address. His mother gave the same explanation for his absence.",
                "24.  On 29 September 2009 the trial court decided that as the presence of I. and Sh. could not be ensured, their statements should be read out and video recordings of their interviews shown.",
                "25.  According to the applicant, he met with I. several times and attempted to persuade him to testify, but I. refused, stating that officers of the Security Service had threatened him with imprisonment if he did.",
                "26.  On 5 November 2009 the trial court convicted the applicant and G. of abuse of office under the circumstances described in paragraph 6 above and sentenced each of them to five years\u2019 imprisonment, suspended for three years. In convicting the applicant, the court relied on:\n(a)  I.\u2019s statements, including the one video-recorded, and Sh.\u2019s statement;\n(b)  evidence presented by the co-defendant G. and witnesses B., S. and P. (see paragraphs 14 to 18 above);\n(c)  evidence that the applicant had had regular telephone contacts with Sh. at the relevant time;\n(d)  expert evidence to the effect that it had been Sh. who had signed for I. in the register of prisoners taken out of the detention facility in April and November 2007 and evidence of police officers that Sh. had taken I. from the detention facility;\n(e)  the statements of witnesses P.S. and I.A., who had been identified in the forged police report as witnesses to I.\u2019s alleged disorderly conduct (see paragraph 6 above), to the effect that their statements had been forged. They stated that they did not know I., had not observed him committing the offence, and had not made any statements about it to the police. P.S. testified at the trial. I.A. gave video-recorded evidence in the course of the pre-trial investigation but did not testify at the trial;\n(f)  expert evidence showing that the signatures attributed to P.S. and I.A. on the statements incriminating I. had in fact been made by certain police officers; and\n(g)  the statements of other witnesses, primarily police officers, concerning the circumstances of I.\u2019s arrest.",
                "27.  The applicant appealed in cassation to the Supreme Court. He argued that Sh.\u2019s statement should not have been relied upon because Sh. had not signed it and had not been examined at the trial. The applicant also stated that the trial court had misstated I.\u2019s evidence, in particular by ascribing to I. statements which were not in his video-recorded interview shown in the course of the trial. In that interview I. had also made other statements indicating that he had worked voluntarily. The applicant questioned the trial court\u2019s decision to trust the statements given by I., a drunk who had a prior conviction for murder and who had failed to remember the content of the notarised statement he had signed just weeks before, which showed that he was susceptible to signing anything presented to him by the investigator.",
                "28.  On 22 April 2010 the Supreme Court held a hearing to examine the appeal. No representative for the defence was present. A prosecutor was present and made oral submissions in opposition to the appeal. At the close of the hearing the court ordered that references to Sh.\u2019s statement be struck from the judgment, since he had not signed his pre-trial statement and thus his statement was inadmissible. The court listed the remaining evidence supporting the applicant\u2019s conviction and considered that, other than Sh.\u2019s statement, the evidence was admissible and sufficiently supported the verdict. The court upheld the remainder of the judgment."

                "6.  The applicant was born in 1982 and lives in Switzerland. He grew up in Iran and entered Switzerland in 2009.",
                "7.  The applicant applied for asylum under the name of L.B. on 13 August 2009, stating that he had entered Switzerland illegally the same day. He was questioned twice, on 18 August and 24 August 2009, by the Swiss authorities responsible for asylum and migration (until 31 December 2014 the authority was called the Bundesamt f\u00fcr Migration, but it was renamed with effect from 1 January 2015 as the Staatssekretariat f\u00fcr Migration, SEM \u2013 hereafter \u201cthe asylum authorities\u201d). An interpreter was present at both hearings and the record was translated for the applicant prior to his signing it. A member of a non-governmental organisation was present at the second hearing as a neutral witness, in order to guarantee the fairness of the hearing. He had the opportunity to add comments at the end of the record of the hearing about any irregularities, but he made no such observations.",
                "8.  During the hearings the applicant stated that he had attended a number of demonstrations in connection with the presidential election in 2009. He had been arrested during one such demonstration on 15 June 2009 in I. He was subsequently placed in prison, where he was severely tortured every day. After twenty-two days in prison, he was scheduled to appear in court on 6 July 2009. He was placed in a bus with about thirty-five other people but managed to escape during a disturbance caused by one of the other detainees when disembarking from the bus. He then managed to hide with his relatives. After his escape, the authorities had sent a court summons to his home and, when he had failed to appear, the court had sentenced him in absentia to thirty-six months\u2019 imprisonment. He managed to leave the country on 25-26 July 2009 with the help of a smuggler. In support of his account, the applicant submitted copies of his identity card, a court summons of 9 July 2009 and a judgment of 21 July 2009. He explained that the judgment had been sent to his home and that a neighbour had given it to him prior to his departure.",
                "9.  On 4 February 2013 the asylum authorities rejected his asylum application and ordered him to leave Switzerland, finding that his account was not credible as it was contradictory and, in relation to key aspects, not sufficiently substantiated. Despite repeated questions, the applicant had been unable to describe what he had experienced during his imprisonment in a detailed and differentiated manner. He had also contradicted himself regarding his transportation from the prison to court and his escape. Neither his alleged arrest in connection with his participation in a demonstration nor his subsequent detention and escape therefrom had been credible. The documents submitted by the applicant could not lead to a different result as they could easily be bought in Iran and falsified. Moreover, the alleged conduct of the Iranian authorities in sending a court summons to the applicant\u2019s home after his escape, rather than going there to arrest him on the spot, was not credible, nor was his submission that the judgment of 21 July 2009 had been sent to his home and given to a neighbour prior to his departure.",
                "10.  As the applicant did not appeal, the decision became final.",
                "11.  On 13 November 2013 the applicant, through a lawyer, lodged an application for his asylum application to be reconsidered. He was by that time using the identity of A. and stated that he had entered Switzerland legally under that name in May 2009 based on a visa to visit his sister, who lived there. In substance, he stated that his relationship with his father had broken down entirely and that as a result he risked being arrested upon his return because his father had ties to the secret service. Moreover, he had been baptised as a Christian on 25 August 2013. Emphasising that Iran applied the death penalty for apostasy, he alleged that he was at risk of ill\u2011treatment on account of his conversion. He submitted a copy of his baptism certificate, issued by a Pentecostal church, a Protestant house church, to support his account.",
                "12.  On 17 January 2014 the asylum authorities, who treated the applicant\u2019s request as a second asylum application, questioned the applicant in person. An interpreter was present and the record was translated for the applicant prior to his signing it. A member of a non-governmental organisation was present as a neutral witness in order to guarantee the fairness of the hearing. He had the opportunity to add comments at the end of the record of the hearing if he witnessed any irregularities, but did not make any such observations.",
                "13.  During the hearing, the applicant stated that he had first had contact with a Catholic church in Switzerland in 2011 and then with the Pentecostal church from early 2013. The members of the latter had gradually become his family. One of them had invited him home once or twice a week to familiarise him with the Bible. He had regularly attended church services and after about six or seven months had been baptised in that church. For him, being a Christian meant believing in Jesus Christ and spreading his message. He stated that he continued to study the Bible and recited parts of it. The principle of honesty enshrined in Christianity was particularly important to him. Even if he were unable to manifest his belief in the future, he would always retain the truthfulness of his faith, which nobody could take away from him. He submitted statements that he had attended different churches to support his account. The applicant did not make any submissions regarding the risk allegedly caused by the broken relationship with his father and the latter\u2019s ties to the secret service.",
                "14.  On 26 February 2014 the asylum authorities rejected the applicant\u2019s application. They considered that his conversion to Christianity did not in and of itself expose him to a real risk of ill-treatment. Such a risk could exist if he proselytised or attracted public attention in another way. Based on his statement, they considered that he did not intend to practise his faith in such a manner. There were no indications that the Iranian authorities were even aware of his conversion. They also doubted that the applicant\u2019s conversion was genuine and lasting, noting, in particular, that it had occurred after the applicant\u2019s first asylum application had been rejected, that the baptism had taken place in a house church rather than a church recognised by the State, and that the applicant did not base his conversion on the key aspects of Christianity, but on the personal relationships he had formed with members of his church community.",
                "15.  On 31 March 2014 the applicant, represented by a lawyer, appealed against that decision. He pointed out that there had been an increased number of arrests of members of Christian house churches since 2010 and argued that his conversion to Christianity in and of itself exposed him to a real risk of ill-treatment. A Christian convert faced a much greater risk of ill-treatment than those born into the Christian religion. His conversion to Christianity was genuine and lasting. He had first had contact with a Catholic church in Switzerland in 2011 and was serious in practising his faith, as evidenced by the documents he had submitted.",
                "16.  On 14 May 2014 the Federal Administrative Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal as manifestly ill-founded. It expressed doubts as to whether his conversion had been genuine or was lasting, but found that this did not have to be determined. It considered that a person could only face a real risk of ill-treatment upon return to Iran if that person\u2019s Christian faith had been manifested in Switzerland in such a way as to make it visible to the outside and if it could be assumed that his or her family and acquaintances in Iran would learn about that active manifestation of faith, even if it was short of proselytising. If close family members were \u201cfanatic\u201d Muslims, they might denounce the conversion to the secret service. In addition, conversion to Christianity might be seen as treason. Where a conversion had taken place abroad, there had to be both an assessment of whether it was genuine and the extent to which it had become publicly known. Even assuming that the applicant\u2019s conversion had been genuine and was lasting, the court considered that he did not manifest his Christian faith in the manner described. There were no indications that the Iranian authorities had even become aware of his conversion.",
                "17.  On 2 May 2016 the applicant, through a lawyer, lodged an application for temporary admission under section 83 of the Aliens Act. He relied on the risks presented by the Iranian authorities and non-state actors on account of his conversion and active membership of a Christian community in Switzerland, as well as his participation in a demonstration in Berne in August 2015 against human rights violations and the persecution of Christians by the Iranian authorities. In that connection, he had signed a letter of protest addressed by the organisers to the Iranian Government, which were thus aware of his conversion. To support his account he submitted photographs, letters of support from various persons and several reports.",
                "18.  On 14 June 2016 the asylum authorities rejected his application, which they had treated as a further asylum application. They noted that the applicant had previously been through two sets of asylum proceedings and that the alleged risk of ill-treatment on account of his conversion to Christianity had already been examined. It was not necessary to examine the matter again as the applicant had not put forward any arguments that could give rise to an assessment that was different from that of the Federal Administrative Court in its judgment of 14 May 2014.",
                "19.  It was true that the Iranian authorities took an interest in the activities of their citizens abroad, but such monitoring was focused on people who stood out from the large number of Iranians critical of the Government and who were perceived as a serious threat by the authorities because of their political or religious activities. Whether a person \u201cstood out\u201d was not so much a question of visibility and the possibility of identifying the person concerned, but was rather one of public exposure. The personality of the individuals concerned, the form of their appearances in public and the content of their public statements were relevant parameters in that regard. The asylum authorities considered that mere participation in a demonstration against the Iranian Government, without the applicant acting in a particular manner or holding a special function, was not sufficient for him to be perceived as a concrete threat by the Iranian authorities. They also noted that there were no indications that the authorities had taken any measures against him.",
                "20.  The Iranian authorities were aware that Iranian citizens at times attempted to rely on conversion to Christianity abroad in order to obtain refugee status in Western countries. Such circumstances would be taken into account by the Iranian authorities but would not, upon someone\u2019s return, lead to ill-treatment within the meaning of the refugee definition. Moreover, it was possible to practise religions other than Islam in Iran in a discreet and private manner. Citing the criteria contained in the Federal Administrative Court\u2019s judgment of 14 May 2014, the State Secretariat for Migration did not contest, per se, the fact that the applicant was part of a Christian circle in Switzerland. There were, however, no indications that he was involved in a leading function or was particularly exposed in other ways in connection with his Christian faith. His participation in a demonstration and the signing of a letter of protest to the Iranian Government did not lead to a different conclusion. He was only an ordinary member of a Christian organisation and there was, therefore, no concrete risk that the Iranian authorities had become aware of his conversion. The asylum authorities concluded that the applicant did not meet the requirements of the refugee definition or those for temporary admission.",
                "21.  On 13 July 2016 the applicant lodged an appeal against that decision, in substance repeating his earlier submissions. On 30 August 2016 the Federal Administrative Court dismissed the appeal as manifestly ill\u2011founded, fully endorsing the asylum authorities\u2019 reasoning.",
                "22.  On 4 October 2016 the State Secretariat for Migration set a deadline for the applicant\u2019s voluntary departure, which passed on 31 October 2016."

                "6.  On 12 March 2003 the Serbian Prime Minister, Mr Zoran \u0110in\u0111i\u0107, was assassinated by members of a criminal group known as the Zemun Clan (Zemunski klan).",
                "7.  The Prime Minister\u2019s assassination prompted the Serbian Government to declare a state of emergency and introduce measures in accordance with the State of Emergency Act 1991 (Zakon o merama za slu\u010daj vanrednog stanja, Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia, no. 19/1991).",
                "8.  During that time a large-scale police operation known as Operation Sabre (Sablja) took place. Approximately 10,000 people were arrested during the operation and placed in pre-trial detention.",
                "9.  The state of emergency lasted until 23 April 2003.",
                "10.  The applicant was a member of a criminal group linked to the Zemun Clan. During Operation Sabre all members of the Zemun Clan and groups linked to it were arrested and questioned about the Prime Minister\u2019s assassination. Those arrested were also questioned about other crimes such as murders, abductions and drug trafficking.",
                "11.  The applicant\u2019s arrest took place at around 4 p.m. on 1 April 2003, when five members of the Special Anti-Terrorist Unit broke into the apartment in which he was hiding with five friends.",
                "12.  The applicant claims that on the arrival of the Special Anti-Terrorist Unit he was subjected to physical and verbal abuse. Its members immediately started to kick and beat him indiscriminately all over his body and face. They put a pillowcase over his head, verbally abused him and made threats aimed at his family. The maltreatment continued for an hour. On the recording of his arrest, which was broadcast on national television at the beginning of April 2003, he was shown with visible bruises on his face.",
                "13.  At around 6 p.m. the applicant and his friends were taken to the police station and left in the corridor. According to the applicant, police officers passing by sporadically hit and kicked him and his friends. He could not identify them as his face was still covered with a pillowcase.",
                "14.  At some point two police officers came and took the applicant for questioning. He was taken to an office in which seven to nine people were present. Two or three of them were women.",
                "15.  According to the applicant, the maltreatment continued there. He was beaten with baseball bats and police truncheons. He was beaten on the soles of his feet and the palms of his hands. A truncheon was inserted several times into his anus. At one point, a nylon bag was put over the pillowcase which made him lose consciousness. During all that time the applicant remembered hearing his friends screaming.",
                "16.  At around 3.30 a.m. on 2 April 2003 two police officers took him to a solitary confinement cell. He was unable to walk so the officers carried him. In the cell his handcuffs were taken off and a detention order was put before him for signature.",
                "17.  As alleged by the applicant, approximately half an hour later two police officers entered the cell. They handcuffed him, put a bag over his head and took him for questioning. During that time he was again beaten, kicked and maltreated. Throughout this time, he was not allowed to drink any water.",
                "18.  In the applicant\u2019s version of events, after approximately two hours of maltreatment he was returned to the solitary confinement cell. He was kept there for eleven days. During the first five days no food was given to him. Afterwards, he was given one sandwich per day. Throughout that period police officers routinely questioned and ill-treated him in the same way as before.",
                "19.  At approximately 10 p.m. on 12 April 2003 the applicant was transferred to Belgrade District Prison (Okru\u017eni zatvor), where he remained for a year and two months pending the outcome of the criminal proceedings instituted against him.",

D.S. gave the names of several of the police officers involved and stated that he had not seen any injuries on the applicant.

On 23 July 2013 his constitutional appeal was rejected by the Constitutional Court, whose decision was served on the applicant on 11 September 2013. The court primarily considered the applicant\u2019s complaints under Article 6 of the Convention and found them to be manifestly ill-founded. As to the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 3 of the Convention, the Constitutional Court found it to be outside its temporal jurisdiction in view of the date of entry into force of the Constitution itself. In respect of the other complaints, the Constitutional Court held, inter alia, that:\n\u201cit is not enough to allege a violation of one\u2019s rights in a constitutional appeal or list the constitutional rights that are considered to be violated and reasons for their violations based on the appellant\u2019s subjective estimation or evaluation, but to put each mentioned reason into a direct relationship with the allegedly violated constitutional right, and a violation or denial of a certain constitutional right has to be caused by an act or action that occurred before the entry into force of the Constitution. This also implies that specific and detailed reasons of the alleged violation of the constitutional right have to be specified in the constitutional appeal, because only a causal link presented in such manner may compel the Court to find a violation or denial of a certain right.\u201d"

After having explained in detail the composition and acts of a criminal organisation, the Public Prosecutor indicated that the applicant was a member of another organisation, which had threatened and extracted money from \u0130.Y., a member of the first one. In his recapitulation of the events, the Public Prosecutor mentioned a certain A.V.O., who he claimed to have been involved in the money transactions at issue and to have been threatened by that second criminal organisation.

In describing the events at issue, the Public Prosecutor once again maintained that A.V.O. had been involved in the transactions and had been threatened by fellow members of the applicant\u2019s criminal organisation. He further indicated that the unfolding of the events had been corroborated by the statements of all of the accused, but that they had all denied having threatened \u0130.Y. and M.Y. Finally, relying on the telephone recordings and the statements of the other accused, the Public Prosecutor proposed that the applicant should be found guilty as charged.",

At that time he was diagnosed with viral hepatitis C, chronic cholecystitis, and radiculitis. The applicant complained of suffering from sleeping disorders and anxiety and was placed in the psychiatric ward of the prison hospital. On 16 August 2005 he was transferred to the infectious ward, where he was treated for his viral hepatitis C. The applicant was discharged from the prison hospital on 10 September 2005.",

After the operation the scar became infected and the applicant was sent to the prison hospital on 25 January 2008 on account of his deteriorating health. At that time the applicant\u2019s diagnosis was as follows: chronic arterial insufficiency of the lower limbs, arterial occlusion and obliterating arteritis, and subungual panaritium.",
                "9.  On 29 January 2008 the applicant had his toenail removed. He spent the post-surgery period under permanent medical supervision in the prison hospital. Although he was provided with painkillers and treated with antibiotics, the applicant, according to the case file, complained every day about severe pain in his right foot. On 25 February 2008 he was seen by an angiosurgeon, who recommended that he undergo a dopplerography of the legs and that his transcutaneous oxygen pressure (\u201cTc PO2\u201d) be measured. The surgeon would decide on the need to amputate the big toe on the applicant\u2019s right foot on the basis of these tests.",
                "10.  According to a note made by a prison hospital doctor in the applicant\u2019s medical file on 25 March 2008, the dopplerography and Tc PO2 test could not be organised in the prison hospital for technical reasons. The doctor noted an improvement in the applicant\u2019s general condition and concluded that in any event, and notwithstanding the specialist\u2019s recommendation, there was no need for those examinations, given that there were no \u201cabsolute indications\u201d that surgery was called for. On 27 March 2008 the applicant was discharged from the prison hospital and sent back to Tbilisi Prison no. 1 with a recommendation that he continue palliative treatment on an outpatient basis.",
                "11.  At the request of the applicant, on 5 May 2008 the board of forensic experts of the Ministry of Justice \u2013 having examined him \u2013 drew up a medical report (\u201cthe 5 May 2008 medical report\u201d), which diagnosed the applicant as suffering from the following: arteritis, occlusion of the arteries in the right shin, stenosis of the arteries in the left shin, artery deficiency in the right lower limb (at stage IV of the disease), necrosis of tissue in the right big toe, cardiac ischaemia, second-degree angina pectoris, second\u2011degree arterial hypertension, second-degree cardiac insufficiency, and low\u2011activity chronic hepatitis C. The experts concluded that from a cardiological point of view the applicant\u2019s condition was potentially serious. As for his vascular condition, the main blood vessels in both of his legs were damaged and his condition was serious. They recommended that he be placed in a specialist cardiology clinic and have his toe amputated.",

On 20 May 2008 the applicant\u2019s lawyers complained to the Director of the Prisons Department of the Ministry of Justice (\u201cthe Prisons Department\u201d) that their client, who had been in the prison hospital since 25 January 2008, had been sent to Tbilisi Prison No. 1, despite the seriousness of his state of health, and that the treatment in that hospital had not produced any results. They complained that the applicant\u2019s condition had deteriorated there. The lawyers requested that the applicant be taken to hospital on the grounds that his life was in danger. On the same day they sent the same request to the director and the head doctor at the medical unit of Tbilisi Prison No. 1.",
                "13.  On 27 May 2008 the head of the welfare unit of the Prisons Department referred the lawyers\u2019 request to the prison governor and a group of qualified medical experts \u201cfor an opinion\u201d. He observed that, in accordance with ministerial order no. 717, patients were hospitalised on the orders of the prison governor, following a report by the head doctor of the prison\u2019s medical unit.",

Following that letter, on 3 June 2008 one of the applicant\u2019s lawyers contacted the prison governor reminding him of the terms of ministerial order no. 717 and asking him what the response of the head doctor had been and enquiring as to when the applicant would be hospitalised.",
                "15.  On 9 June 2008 the Prisons Department informed the lawyers that the applicant had been placed in the prison hospital on 5 June 2008.",
                "16.  According to the daily notes made in his medical file, the applicant continued to suffer from pain in the right foot. It can be seen from the contents of the medical file that his right foot was treated with antiseptic products and bandaged daily. During that period the applicant was examined by a vascular specialist twice: on 11 June and on 31 July 2008. On 11 June 2008 the vascular specialist recommended that the bandage be changed regularly and the toe treated with antiseptic products. He also prescribed Alprostapint infusions. On 31 July 2008 the vascular specialist recommended a Tc PO2 test in order to assess the possibility of amputating the toe, and prescribed continuing palliative treatment. It appears from the case file that the relevant drugs were administered to the applicant by his wife and other family members.",
                "17.  On 7 August 2008 the applicant underwent a Tc PO2 test at a specialist hospital. On the basis of the results of the test the examining doctor concluded that the microcirculation in the lower limbs of the applicant (particularly in the right foot) was very low. In his view, surgical intervention was not appropriate because the particularly low level of oxygen in the right foot would have hampered the healing of the resulting wound.",
                "18.  On 8 September 2008 the applicant was discharged from the prison hospital because of the appeal court\u2019s decision to suspend his prison sentence (see paragraph 28 below).",
                "19.  On the basis of the 5 May 2008 medical report (see paragraph 11 above), and in view of the fact that his treatment at the prison hospital was producing no results, on 14 May 2008 the applicant applied to the Tbilisi City Court for his sentence to be suspended on health grounds (under Article 607 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure \u2013 \u201cthe CCP\u201d). A representative of the Prisons Department opposed the application on the grounds that the prison hospital had \u201ca medical service capable of treating the applicant\u201d and that \u201cif necessary he [would] be transferred to a specialist clinic\u201d. One of the experts who had produced the above-mentioned report confirmed to the court judge that the applicant was seriously ill. However, as he had no knowledge of the medical facilities at the prison hospital, he said he could not judge whether it was appropriate to keep the applicant there. He also confirmed that the applicant\u2019s right big toe had to be amputated.",
                "20.  On 11 June 2008 the Tbilisi City Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s request, on the grounds that the prison hospital had a medical service capable of providing the necessary treatment and that the applicant, who was being looked after by specialist doctors, would be transferred to a specialist clinic if necessary.",
                "21.  On 18 June 2008 the applicant\u2019s lawyer submitted to the court his comments on the record of the hearing of 11 June 2008. The record of the hearing, according to those comments, did not refer to the expert\u2019s opinion in respect of the risk to the applicant\u2019s life. The expert had said that the applicant\u2019s gangrene, which was now at the fourth (and last) stage, could cause septicemia and death if not properly treated. Regarding the applicant\u2019s heart condition, the expert had said that the applicant needed treatment in a specialist clinic to prevent sudden death. On 19 June 2008 the court granted that request and ordered that the record of hearing be amended by adding the expert\u2019s comments.",
                "22.  The applicant appealed against the decision of 11 June 2008, pointing out that, according to the medical experts who had examined him, the treatment at the prison hospital had produced no results and that, if he was not properly treated, the question of the amputation of various parts of his right lower limb could arise. The applicant\u2019s lawyers pointed out that prisoners frequently died as a result of a lack of treatment at the prison hospital. They also complained about the Prisons Department having joined the trial as a party to the proceedings, which was in breach of Article 617 \u00a7 4 of the CCP. In their view, a representative of the Prisons Department was not in a position to assess the danger that detention might pose to the life of the applicant. Subsequently, the lawyers requested that the applicant\u2019s doctor and the doctor from the specialist hospital who had treated the applicant on 7 August 2008 be heard as witnesses (see paragraph 17 above). At the examination in the specialist hospital in question, apart from the findings of the above-mentioned expert report, Buerger\u2019s disease of the lower limbs had also been diagnosed.",
                "23.  At a hearing before the Court of Appeal on 4 September 2008 the applicant\u2019s lawyers requested that the representative of the Prisons Department be debarred from joining the proceedings as a party, in accordance with Article 617 \u00a7 4 of the CCP. The Court of Appeal allowed that request but authorised the representative in question to attend the hearing in order to reply to any questions. It also decided to call the prison hospital surgeon, the vascular specialist (see paragraph 17 above), and the forensic expert (see paragraph 11 above) as witnesses.",
                "24.  At the next hearing on 8 September 2008 the forensic expert repeated that the applicant\u2019s state of health was serious, and that Article 7 \u00a7 2 of order no. 72/N (issued by the Health Minister) concerning the early termination of prison sentences on health grounds was indisputably applicable. He added that necrosis of the tissue of the lower limb had set in and was progressively affecting the limb from the bottom up. If that were to continue, the applicant might develop septicemia and die. In his view, it was impossible to cure the applicant completely.",
                "25.  The applicant\u2019s doctor \u2013 a surgeon who was a member of the prison hospital\u2019s permanent staff \u2013 also gave evidence before the Court of Appeal, explaining the diagnosis and confirming that his patient was seriously ill, with the arterial disease having reached the fourth and final stage. He said that he had seen the applicant in December 2007 and also in May 2008 and that no serious necrosis had been observed at that time. He further explained that at that stage of the disease the treatment usually prescribed was either palliative or surgical. The applicant was being given palliative treatment with medicines (antioxidants, protective drugs, sedatives). An operation was not recommended because it might make his condition worse. The likelihood of the scar healing was nil. The doctor was gradually removing the necrosed tissue in the right foot. The doctor also confirmed that the applicant\u2019s illness was chronic, progressive and that he needed constant medical treatment. He added that he could not be cured at the prison hospital but that there was a clinic outside the prison that could treat this kind of patient. In answer to a question from the judge, the doctor said that the applicant had been hospitalised twice after his operation and that at the relevant time the necrosis had not reached such an advanced stage. At that time the prison hospital doctors had done all they could to halt the development of the necrosis but without much success. If the situation continued, the applicant might have to have his entire right leg amputated.",
                "26.  The vascular specialist \u2013 a doctor at the prison hospital \u2013 said that he had examined the applicant in December 2007 and found that the gangrene had already affected the big toe of the right foot. This had then quickly spread, despite the treatment administered. Shortly before the hearing the applicant had been prevented from lying down and had been made to stay in a sitting position. His state of health was worsening daily. The results of the Tc PO2 test had shown that the oxygen tension in the right foot stood at level 2 in the lying-down position and at level 21 in the sitting position (the normal level being 60-70; an indicator of 30 was necessary if the wound could be expected to heal properly). Accordingly, amputation was impossible. The vascular specialist said that the prison hospital was complying with his orders but that there was no specialist unit. In his view, the applicant\u2019s lower left limb was also damaged, but not yet affected by gangrene. At the time it was a question of saving the applicant\u2019s life and subsequently considering whether to amputate the right leg.",
                "27.  In his final address the applicant\u2019s lawyer drew the Court of Appeal\u2019s attention to the fact that, despite the presence of gangrene as early as December 2007, the applicant had been sent to Prison No. 1 and left there untreated. Given that, according to the doctors, the applicant could not be cured, the lawyer requested that her client be dispensed from having to serve the remainder of his prison sentence (under Article 608 \u00a7 1 of the CCP).",
                "28.  In a judgment of 8 September 2008 the Court of Appeal ordered that the applicant\u2019s prison sentence be suspended pending a substantial improvement in his state of health, provided that he undergo a medical examination every six months and provide the court with the results thereof. The applicant was immediately released.",
                "29.  According to a medical report of 6 March 2009, the applicant suffered from cardiac ischaemia, second-degree angina pectoris, third\u2011degree hypertension and second-degree heart failure. From a cardiological point of view, his heart condition remained serious. With regard to his arteries, the applicant suffered from Buerger\u2019s disease, occlusion of the arteries in the right tibia, stenosis of the arteries in the left tibia, chronic arterial deficiency in the right lower limb at the fourth stage of the disease and gangrene of the tissue in the right big toe. The gangrene was still described as progressive. The experts concluded that the applicant required cardiological and angiological treatment in a specialist institution.",
                "30.  Over May and June 2011 the applicant underwent another forensic examination. It appeared from the report of 21 June 2011 that on 6 February 2011 the applicant had had the lower part of his right leg amputated. At the same time he was diagnosed with gangrene on the big toe of the left foot. While confirming his diagnosis from a cardiological point of view as potentially serious the four experts involved in the examination also concluded that the applicant\u2019s angiological condition had deteriorated as a result of ischemia. Thus, from the angiological point of view he was categorised as a seriously ill patient."

                "6.  In March 2014 a large-scale criminal investigation was initiated against several persons for money laundering and fiscal fraud. On 3 December 2014 the investigation was extended in respect of thirty-two other persons, including the applicant.",
                "7.  Within the framework of the criminal investigation, on 4 December 2014 several police officers carried out a search at the applicant\u2019s home. According to the search report, signed by the applicant and by her appointed lawyer without any objections, the search started at 6.15 a.m. and lasted until 2 p.m.",
                "8.  Immediately after the search and in accordance with the provisions of Articles 265-266 of the Romanian Criminal Code of Procedure (hereinafter RCCP, see paragraph 33 below), namely on the basis of an order to appear before the investigation body, the applicant was taken by police officers to the Bucharest police headquarters.",
                "9.  According to the record drawn up at the time, the enforcement of the order to appear was executed between 2.10 p.m. and 2.40 p.m., when the applicant arrived at the police station.",
                "10.  The order to appear had been issued by the prosecutor on 3 December 2014. It mentioned that\n\u201cIn the interests of the investigation ongoing in the above-mentioned criminal file [number] concerning money laundering and fiscal fraud, the questioning of [the applicant\u2019s name and identification data] in her capacity of suspect is necessary.\nThe criminal investigation bodies (...) will bring the suspect to the police headquarters on 4 December 2014 for the purpose of making a statement [before the investigating authorities].\u201d",
                "11.  The documents on file show that between 8.40 a.m. on 4 December 2014 and 3 a.m. the next day, the investigating authorities, namely five prosecutors and six judicial police officers, conducted interviews in respect of fourteen witnesses and twenty-five suspects and/or defendants in connection with the criminal investigation involving the applicant.",
                "12.  According to the register kept by the police to record third parties entering the police station on a daily basis, the applicant\u2019s appointed lawyer, Mr R.-M.S., entered the premises of the police headquarters at 4.10 p.m. The applicant contended that up until that time, her lawyer had been prevented from joining her because he had not submitted a written mandate proving that he lawfully represented her (see also paragraph 22 in fine, below).",
                "13.  It appears from the file that during her stay in the police station, the applicant\u2019s phone conversations were tapped.",
                "14.  At an unspecified time before 7.32 p.m., a prosecutor informed the applicant that she was a suspect in an ongoing criminal investigation, and was to be charged with complicity in fiscal fraud; the applicant was also informed of the rights and obligations she had in that capacity. When invited to give a statement, she refused, claiming that she was unwell and needed medical assistance.\nThe minutes recording this interview do not mention the exact time of their drafting; they are signed by the applicant, who confirmed having received a copy. Her lawyer does not appear to have been present.",
                "15.  The Government contended that the applicant\u2019s request for medical assistance had been part of her defence strategy, as proved, in their view, by the transcripts of a phone conversation she had had with a third party at 7.14 p.m., in which she was advised accordingly (see also paragraph 13 above). The same argument was backed, according to the Government, by the conclusions of the medical investigations, which attested to the fact that no urgent need for medical care had been identified in her case (see paragraph 16 below).",
                "16.  At 7.32 p.m. an ambulance was called to the police station. It arrived at 7.50 p.m. and provided medical care (mainly intravenous infusion with minerals) to the applicant until 8.31 p.m., when she was taken to the Emergency University Hospital. Accompanied by police officers, she arrived at the hospital at 8.40 p.m., and was diagnosed with lipothymia. She remained in the hospital until 00.10 a.m. the next day and several medical examinations were performed during this time, following which vitamins, calcium and analgesics were administered. The diagnosis when the applicant left the hospital, accompanied by police officers, was neurovegetative dystonia and light hypokalemia.",
                "17.  The applicant claimed that during the whole time she was in hospital she had been guarded by police officers, who had then escorted her back to the police headquarters.",
                "18.  At about 00.22 a.m. the applicant\u2019s questioning started. In the presence of her chosen lawyer, the applicant refused to give a statement on the grounds that she was very tired, having spent the last four hours in hospital. She also referred to the fact that neither she nor her lawyer had been given the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the contents of the criminal case file in which she was a suspect.",
                "19.  Subsequently, at 01.10 a.m., the applicant was informed in the presence of her chosen lawyer that the prosecutor had decided to remand her in custody (re\u0163inere) for twenty-four hours.",
                "20.  Her lawyer lodged a complaint with the prosecutor against the decision to remand her in custody, as well as another complaint concerning her being unlawfully deprived of her liberty as of 12.00 p.m. on 4 December 2014.",
                "21.  In the first complaint, it is claimed that the order to appear became effective on 4 December 2014 at 6.20 a.m., and that the applicant was de facto remanded in custody as of 2.20 p.m. It is argued that the applicant\u2019s deprivation of liberty throughout that interval was unlawful and unjustified, aimed solely at obtaining statements from her under duress.",
                "22.  In the second complaint it is claimed that on 4 December 2014, as of 12.00 p.m. when the search of her home ended, the applicant\u2019s liberty to move around was restricted, as proved by the fact that she had been accompanied by police officers not only to the police station but also to the hospital, where she had been taken under escort to obtain medical assistance. The applicant mentioned that her lawyer had not been allowed to accompany her or to assist her because he did not have a written mandate, even though the lack of such a document was objectively justified by the circumstances in which she had been taken to the police station.",
                "23.  The prosecutor dismissed both complaints on the same day, holding that the measure to remand the applicant in custody was lawful, necessary and proportional to the gravity of the charge. He stated that the order to appear became effective after the house search had been performed, the presence of the applicant during the search being necessary in relation to its conduct and thus outside the limits of such an order. The prosecutor further considered that the time interval during which the applicant was under medical surveillance could not be included within the eight-hour time-limit set out by Article 265 \u00a7 12, as that was an incident excluding the responsibility of the investigating authorities. The limitation of her lawyer\u2019s access to the criminal file had been justified by the necessity to get to the truth and to obtain from the applicant a genuine statement, uninfluenced by those already given by the other suspects or witnesses.",
                "24.  On 5 December 2014, relying on testimonial, documentary and audio surveillance evidence, the prosecutor asked the Bucharest County Court to place the applicant in pre-trial detention (arest preventiv) for thirty days as her release posed a threat to public order.",
                "25.  By an interlocutory judgment delivered on 6 December 2014, the Bucharest County Court allowed the prosecutor\u2019s request and ordered the applicant\u2019s detention until 3 January 2015. An appeal lodged against this was dismissed by the Bucharest Court of Appeal on 15 December 2014. Her pre-trial detention was extended for another thirty days by a decision of the Bucharest County Court issued on 29 January 2015, upheld on appeal.",
                "26.  The applicant was released on 11 February 2015 after two months of pre-trial detention.",
                "27.  It appears that the proceedings on the merits are still pending.",
                "28.  The applicant claimed that for two months, she had been placed in a cell measuring 9 square metres, which she had shared with three other detainees. She also complained about the poor conditions of hygiene, lack of ventilation and natural light. According to the applicant, the toilet was not separated from the living area by any partition, thus offering no privacy.",
                "29.  The Government provided information about the applicant\u2019s conditions of detention. They submitted that the applicant had been detained in a cell measuring 9.32 sq m, which she had occupied with two or three other detainees from 5 to 8 December 2014. From 9 December to the date of her release, the applicant had been placed in a room measuring 9.42 sq m, along with two or three others.",
                "30.  They stated that each cell had sanitary facilities such as a toilet and a shower, which were separated from the rest of the cell by a curtain. Both cells had access to natural and artificial light, as well as ventilation provided by a double-glazed window measuring 115cm x 77cm."

She also stated that she had antedated the registration at M.C.I.\u2019s request. The applicant did not change his statements and continued to deny any involvement in committing the intellectual forgery. He stated that he had only called N.G. and asked her to help M.C.I. with the registration of the applications as the latter had arrived after closing time.\nTwo other witnesses made statements at the same hearing.

By a judgment of 9 May 2005 the Buftea District Court convicted N.G. of intellectual forgery, imposed a suspended sentence of six months\u2019 imprisonment and placed her on probation. The court noted that N.G. had given contradictory statements to the prosecutor and to the court with respect to the applicant\u2019s role in the commission of the offence. It held that the statement given to the prosecutor, but not maintained before the court \u2013 according to which the applicant had asked her to antedate the registration of the applications \u2013 was not corroborated by the other pieces of evidence adduced before it. The applicant was therefore acquitted on the grounds of not having committed the offence with which he had been charged.",

However, when R.A. realised that the applicant would continue to write articles about the Ministry\u2019s activities, he proposed him money in exchange for stopping writing the articles.

                "5.  The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in Ankara.",
                "6.  The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties and as they appear from the documents submitted by them, may be summarised as follows.",
                "7.  At the time of the events giving rise to the application the applicant was serving as a chief police officer in Ankara.",
                "8.  On 12 April 2002 a woman named S.K. filed a criminal complaint with officers at Demirf\u0131rka police station, alleging that she had been taken into a police car by two officers on the pretext of her being a suspect. Afterwards, they had driven her around in the car and finally had taken her to an empty plot of land where she had been raped in the car by one of the police officers. He had been wearing glasses and had held a police radio in his hand. She identified the vehicle\u2019s licence plate.",
                "9.  The applicant and the other police officer were immediately called into the police station for questioning as they had been assigned to the vehicle which had the licence plate identified by S.K.",
                "10.  In his statement to the police, made in the presence of his lawyer, the applicant said that he had picked up S.K. around 2 a.m. while he was patrolling with his colleague, S.A., on Talatpa\u015fa Boulevard. He submitted that S.K., who had looked intoxicated, had hailed them, stopped their car, and told them that she worked as a \u201ckonsomatris\u201d, a bar hostess who entertains male guests by keeping them company. She had asked for their help to go to a safe place and the applicant had offered to take her to her home, which she had declined. According to the applicant they had also offered to take her to the police station, which she had also declined. Finally, they had taken her to S.A.\u2019s home with the intention of sobering her up. The applicant stated that when S.A. was in the kitchen preparing something to eat, S.K. had started behaving strangely, taking off her clothes and acting in a sexually inviting manner. The applicant said that as a result of being aroused he had simply ejaculated in his own hand but had not touched her. He had then called S.A. and told him that they had to leave immediately. The applicant stated that they had left S.K. in front of a hotel at 3 a.m. and had continued with their patrol until they had been called into the police station for questioning.",
                "11.  S.A. confirmed the applicant\u2019s version of events in his statement to the police on the same day.",
                "12.  In an additional statement to the police, also made on the same day, S.K. told the police that she could not remember whether the police officers had taken her to an apartment or some other place as she had been very intoxicated.",
                "13.  A forensic medical examination of S.K. was carried out on the same day, showing that she had no bruises on her body.",
                "14.  A forensic expert report drafted on 15 April 2002 stated that the underwear that the applicant had been wearing on the night in question had S.K.\u2019s and his own DNA on it. Furthermore, napkins found in the rubbish bin on the balcony of S.A.\u2019s apartment had traces of the applicant\u2019s semen.",
                "15.  On 6 June 2002 the Ankara governor decided to authorise the prosecution of the applicant and S.A. for alleged rape and abuse of authority. The applicant lodged an objection with the Ankara District Administrative Court seeking annulment of the governor\u2019s decision, but it was dismissed.",
                "16.  On 15 November 2002 the Ankara public prosecutor filed an indictment with the Ankara Criminal Court of First Instance, charging the applicant and S.A. with abuse of public authority and the unlawful use of a public vehicle under Article 240 of the former Turkish Criminal Code and section 16 of the Law on Vehicles (Law no. 237).",
                "17.  In her statement in the first-instance proceedings, S.K. said that she had flagged down a police car that day to ask for help. As she had been intoxicated, she could not remember exactly what had happened later or which officer had raped her.",
                "18.  The chief public prosecutor submitted an opinion on the merits and stated that the applicant\u2019s conduct should be reclassified as rape and unlawful detention and that of S.A. as having aided and abetted those acts. He therefore argued that the case should be referred to the Ankara Assize Court, which has jurisdiction to hear such charges.",
                "19.  On 13 July 2004 the Ankara Criminal Court of First Instance ruled that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the case. It found that the offences committed by the applicant while performing his official duties were rape and the unlawful detention of an adult, which were governed, inter alia, by Articles 251, 416 \u00a7 1 and 429 \u00a7 1 of the former Criminal Code, and the unlawful use of a public vehicle, which came under section 16 of Law no. 237. It stated that those offences had to be tried by assize courts and it therefore referred the case to the Ankara Assize Court.",
                "20.  At a hearing held on 24 March 2005, the Ankara Assize Court heard S.K. who, contrary to her previous statements, submitted that the officers had not raped her and had not taken her anywhere without her consent. She then submitted that she wished to withdraw her complaint.",
                "21.  On 13 September 2005 the Ankara Assize Court acquitted the applicant and S.A. of all charges, holding that there was no evidence of force on S.K.\u2019s body, one of the constituent elements of the offences of rape and unlawful detention. The court further held that despite S.K.\u2019s statement of 24 March 2005, the forensic report of 15 April 2002 had established that the applicant had had intercourse with her. In the absence of evidence that corroborated the fact of the applicant having forced himself on S.K., it could not be established beyond doubt that the act of sexual intercourse itself had not been consensual. The court stated in that connection that even if S.K. had been drunk that night, her allegations of rape and of being held against her will needed to be supported by some sign of resistance. In the light of the conclusion that there had been no indication of a criminal offence committed by the police officers, the court then held that the applicant and S.A. could not be deemed to have committed the separate offence of the unlawful use of a public vehicle. It therefore acquitted them of all the charges.",
                "22.  On 21 September 2005 the acquittal became final as no appeals had been made.",
                "23.  In the aftermath of the events of 12 April 2002 a preliminary disciplinary investigation was launched against the applicant and S.A. on 24 April 2002.",
                "24.  On 2 and 29 May 2002 the applicant was questioned in relation to the allegations of rape against him. He submitted that he had not had sexual intercourse with S.K. He repeated his earlier statements that S.K. had seduced him to the point where he had had to ejaculate in his own hand. The applicant was also requested to submit a written defence statement. He wrote that he had taken S.K. into the police car with the intention of helping her and had not forced himself on her, as alleged by S.K. He pointed out that the forensic expert evidence had established that there had been no traces of violence, whether on S.K.\u2019s body or in the form of any other type of evidence, such as damage to property or blood stains at S.A.\u2019s apartment or inside the police car.",
                "25.  An investigation report dated 6 June 2002, prepared by the police investigator, concluded that the applicant had committed the offence of rape, while S.A. was guilty of the offence of conduct unbecoming and incompatible with the civil service and therefore recommended that the applicant be sanctioned with a deferral of advancement to a higher rank for a period of twenty-four months. The report further stated that a recommendation for a separate criminal investigation against the applicant and S.A. had already been submitted to the governor\u2019s office for authorisation.",
                "26.  On 28 November 2002, the Supreme Disciplinary Council found the applicant guilty of abuse of his authority as a police officer and of sexually assaulting S.K. Noting that the applicant\u2019s appraisal scores had only been average for the years 1999 and 2000, and taking account of the shameful nature of the act he had committed, it found that the applicant could not be given a penalty that was less severe than the one decided on. The relevant parts of the decision read as follows:\n\u201c... the victim complained to the police and confirmed the event by giving the licence plate number of the vehicle and accurately describing the officer as wearing glasses and holding a police radio in his hand. The applicant, on the other hand, hid the facts by denying that he had had intercourse with S.K. [D]espite the fact that the vaginal examination of the victim did not reveal the presence of any active or passive semen, the victim\u2019s statement that she was menstruating on the night in question and the forensic evidence finding traces of both the applicant\u2019s and S.K.\u2019s DNA on the applicant\u2019s underwear and the two napkins found in S.A.\u2019s apartment containing the applicant\u2019s DNA, point to the conclusion that the applicant must have ejaculated prematurely before sexual intercourse. He has therefore committed the offence of \u2018sexual assault\u2019 and he furthermore used his position as a police officer by calling the victim a \u2018suspect\u2019 in order to lure her into the police car ... Criminal proceedings are pending against the applicant on charges of abuse of authority under Article 240 of the Turkish Criminal Code.\n... It has been decided unanimously to dismiss the accused from the police force, in accordance with section 8(6) and (7) of the Disciplinary Regulation of the Security Forces on the grounds that it has been proven that he has committed the offence of sexual assault and of using his position as a police officer for personal ... advantage.\u201d",
                "27.  On an unspecified date the applicant objected to the Supreme Disciplinary Council\u2019s decision before the Ankara Administrative Court. The applicant argued that his dismissal on the basis of a finding that he had committed sexual assault, although he had not been found guilty of that offence by a criminal court, had violated his right to the presumption of innocence.",
                "28.  On 4 July 2003 the Ankara Administrative Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s case, holding that the decision to dismiss the applicant from the police force had been in accordance with the law. The relevant parts of the judgment read as follows:\n\u201cActs, conduct and behaviour of the kind listed in section 8(6), \u2018... rape, sexual assault, ... or attempting to commit any of those offences\u2019 and in section 8 (7), \u2018using his position as a police officer for his own or another person\u2019s advantage\u2019, are sanctioned with dismissal from the police force.\nAfter examination of the file, it appears that the case concerns the applicant\u2019s dismissal from the police force on the basis of a disciplinary investigation which established that he had intercourse with a woman without her consent on the pretext of calling her a suspect .., by asking her to get into a police car so that he could verify her identity at the police station, although in the end he took her to a piece of empty land and had intercourse with her without her consent.\nOn the basis of the case file, statements, the forensic report and other information, the veracity of the accusation is reinforced and therefore the decision to dismiss the applicant is in accordance with the law.\u201d",
                "29.  On 13 March 2006 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal by a majority by endorsing the reasons provided by the Ankara Administrative Court. One judge out of the five expressed a dissenting opinion, reasoning that the applicant had been acquitted of the charges in the parallel criminal proceedings, including of rape, and that therefore the disciplinary decision to dismiss him from the police force on those grounds could no longer be upheld. The dissenting judge further argued that the courts should have reclassified the applicant\u2019s conduct as conduct that was incompatible with the reputation and trust inherent in the functions of an official and sanctioned him with the corresponding penalty of the deferral of moving to a higher rank for a period of sixteen months.",
                "30.  On 23 June 2006 the applicant submitted a request to rectify the decision of 13 March 2006, arguing in the main that the fact that he had been acquitted in the criminal proceedings and had been found innocent of the allegations of rape had not been taken into account in the Supreme Administrative Court\u2019s decision. He further argued that the contradictory conclusions of the criminal and administrative courts in relation to what had happened on the night in question had cast doubt on his innocence.",
                "31.  The Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s request on 17 June 2008, holding that none of the reasons for rectification he had put forth fell within the exhaustive list of permissible grounds for such a decision in section 54 (1) of the Administrative Procedure Act (Law no. 2577).",
                "32.  In their observations the Government submitted that on 26 November 2008 the applicant had brought proceedings against the Ministry of the Interior and had requested that the reopening of the proceedings for his dismissal from the police force. The applicant relied on the Ankara Assize Court\u2019s final judgment of 13 September 2005, acquitting him of the charges of, inter alia, attempted rape and abuse of authority. He argued before the Ankara Administrative Court that the establishment of his innocence should be regarded as new grounds for reopening the dismissal proceedings. On 27 May 2009 the applicant\u2019s request was dismissed. The Court was not provided with a copy of that decision; however, the Government provided a summary of parts of it, which was not contested by the applicant. According to the Government, the administrative court held that \u201cthe decision of the Assize Court was available on the dates the Supreme Administrative Court examined the applicant\u2019s appellate review and request for rectification of the decision, and that accordingly the court in question made an assessment of the decision rendered by the Assize Court\u201d.",
                "33.  According to the information submitted by the Government, the applicant did not appeal against that decision."

                "6.  During 1991 and 1992 Serbian paramilitary forces gained control of about a third of the territory of Croatia and proclaimed the \u201cSerbian Autonomous Region of Krajina\u201d (Srpska autonomna oblast Krajina, hereinafter \u201cKrajina\u201d). At the beginning of August 1995 the Croatian authorities announced their intention to take military action with the aim of regaining control over Krajina. The operation was codenamed \u201cStorm\u201d (Oluja) and took place from 4 to 7 August 1995. Before the military action, the vast majority of the population of Krajina fled Croatia. Most of them went to Bosnia and Herzegovina but some also went to Serbia. Some returned to Croatia after the war. The number of people who fled is estimated at between 100,000 and 150,000.",
                "7.  On 5 November 1997 Croatia ratified the Convention.",
                "8.  The applicants and P.M. (born in 1942), who was the husband of one of the applicants and the father of the others, lived in Razboji\u0161te, near the larger village of Krupa, on the territory of Krajina. During the night of 4 to 5 August 1995 all the family, save for P.M., fled Croatia. P.M. was killed during Operation Storm on 5 August 1995.\nAccording to the applicants, P.M. was killed in the courtyard of his house in Razboji\u0161te, although he was an unarmed civilian.\nAccording to the Government, he was armed and was killed in an exchange of fire with the Croatian Army in the broader area of Krupa. The villages of Razboji\u0161te, Krupa and \u017degar and the settlement of Mili\u0107i are located near each other.",
                "9.  On 11 October 1995 the police found the remains of an unidentified person in Razboji\u0161te and they were buried in Gra\u010dac Cemetery under the number 434.",
                "10.  On June 2002 exhumations were carried out at Gra\u010dac Cemetery. The process was conducted under the auspices of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (Me\u0111unarodni kazneni sud za biv\u0161u Jugoslaviju) and the County State Attorney\u2019s Office in Zadar. Body no. 434 was also dug up and an identity card was found in the name of P.M. The remains were examined at the Institute for Forensic Medicine in Zagreb (Zavod za sudsku medicinu i kriminalistiku) and on 15 October 2002 an autopsy report was issued which concluded that the cause of death had been three wounds from shelling. On 24 November 2003 the third applicant identified the remains as those of her father, P.M.",
                "11.  The police opened an investigation into the circumstances of P.M.\u2019s death after the applicants on 5 September 2005 brought a claim for damages with the State Attorney\u2019s Office in connection with his killing (see paragraph 20 below).",
                "12.  On 21 October 2005 the police interviewed \u017d.M., who said that P.M. had joined a village guard unit during the war. \u017d.M. did not know who might have killed P.M.",
                "13.  On 11 August 2015 the Zadar police received an anonymous letter stating that on 10 August 1995 two men, V.G. and M.B., had killed twelve elderly people in the village of \u017degar in the \u201cMili\u0107a\u201d cave, near Krupa.",
                "14.  On 25 August 2015 the police interviewed O.M. and S.M., residents of \u017degar. O.M. said that he had never heard of someone being killed in the \u201cMili\u0107a\u201d cave even though he had lived all his life in the area. He also said that during Operation Storm five people from the settlement called Mili\u0107i, part of the village of \u017degar, had been killed, including P.M. They had all been members of the paramilitary forces and had been armed. He had heard that they all had perished in rocky areas of the village but did not know the cause and manner of their deaths.",

On 14 September 2015 the police interviewed V.G., a captain in the Croatian Army during Operation Storm, who had been in command of the Zadar Military Police Third Company of the 72nd Battalion, who said that he had never been to \u017degar and had never heard of anyone being killed there. He had been in Benkovac (a town situated some forty kilometres from \u017degar) throughout Operation Storm. He had also said that he could state with certainty that none of the members of his unit had committed any crimes, otherwise he would have known about it.",

He had been near Obrovac (a town situated some twenty kilometres from \u017degar) during the military operation.",

On 22 January 2016 the Zadar County State Attorney\u2019s Office informed its counterpart in Split County that it had not been able to confirm the allegations made in the anonymous letter of 11 August 2015 as there was no indication that twelve elderly people had been killed in the \u201cMili\u0107a\u201d cave. However, five members of the Serbian paramilitary forces had been killed during Operation Storm, including P.M. Enquiries had therefore been stopped since the information given in the anonymous letter had proved to be unreliable.",

It had also not been established that he had been killed by members of the Croatian army or police in areas where there had been no operations related to the war. In addition, the claim had become statute\u2011barred. During the proceedings information was obtained from the archives of the Ministry of Defence showing that the Croatian army had entered the area in question on 6 August 1995, whereas P.M. had been killed on 5 August 1995. The first-instance court also accepted the statement of the witness O.M., who said that the village of \u017degar had been shelled on 5 August 1995.\nThe first-instance judgment was upheld by the Zagreb County Court on 21 September 2010.\nOn 10 June 2014 the Supreme Court upheld the lower courts\u2019 judgments in respect of the ruling that the applicants\u2019 claim had become statute-barred.",

                "17.  On 21 December 2010 an official of the Kyiv city police wrote to the PGO that its information about the applicant\u2019s address was outdated (he had sold the flat in 2003 and had not lived there since).",
                "18.  On 22 December 2010 the PGO enquired with the Kyiv city and regional address bureau about the applicant\u2019s registered address and received a reply on 23 December 2010 that he lived in Yagotyn in the Kyiv region.",
                "19.  On 22 December 2010 the PGO instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant under Article 365 \u00a7 3 of the CC (exceeding of powers by an official leading to grave consequences \u2013 see paragraph 39 below). In describing the applicant\u2019s actus reus, the prosecutor found that he had bypassed the registry of the Ministry of Justice when accepting the request from Naftogaz and issuing his letter in reply; that his conclusion about the existence of exceptional conditions for Naftogaz not to pursue a bidding procedure had been in contradiction with the applicable legal provisions; and that he had had no right to put that conclusion on official Ministry of Justice paper. The subsequent extension by Naftogaz of its contract with Magisters Ltd had caused considerable losses to the State budget.",
                "20.  Later that day the investigator called the applicant by telephone to summon him for questioning. At the time, he was in hospital with his wife, who was giving birth to their third child.",
                "21.  In the afternoon of 22 December 2010, the applicant appeared before the investigator and after being questioned was arrested at 4.50 p.m. under Articles 106 and 115 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (\u201cthe CCP\u201d; see paragraph 41 below). According to the official report, the applicant had been arrested on the grounds that \u201ceyewitnesses, including victims, directly identified [him] as the one who had committed the offence\u201d. His arrest was justified by the necessity to prevent him evading justice or from obstructing the establishment of the truth, and to ensure the execution of an eventual court judgment. The arrest report had the following description of the facts giving rise to the prosecution:\n\u201c... during the period from 5 to 27 February 2009 [the applicant], exceeding his official powers, issued an expert conclusion with knowingly false information, as a result of which considerable damage, amounting to 1,697,600 [Ukrainian] hryvnias [equal to about 152,000 euros at the time] was caused to [Naftogaz]. In other words, he is suspected of committing a criminal offence under Article 365 \u00a7 3 of the [CC].\u201d",
                "22.  The procedural rights of arrestees were also listed. The applicant signed it with a remark that he considered his arrest as unlawful given that he had complied with the investigator\u2019s summons in accordance with the CCP and that there was no risk of him hindering the establishment of the truth as he was no longer a civil servant.",
                "23.  On 23 December 2010 the applicant was officially charged under Article 365 \u00a7 3 of the CC.",
                "24.  On 24 December 2010 the applicant challenged his arrest before a court. He claimed that the investigator had failed to refer to any factual circumstances to justify his arrest under Articles 106 and 115 of the CCP. The applicant contended that he had appeared before the investigator upon the latter\u2019s first summons, despite the fact that on that day his wife had been in hospital giving birth. That indicated, in his opinion, that he had had no intention of absconding or hindering the investigation.",
                "25.  Also on 24 December 2010 the investigator applied to the court for the applicant to be held in pre-trial detention. The necessity of that preventive measure was explained as follows:\n\u201cHaving regard to [the applicant\u2019s] role in the commission of the offence and his causing serious damage to State interests, his age, state of health, family and financial situation, and other circumstances characterising him, the investigation has grounds to believe that [the applicant] will try to influence the witnesses in this case given his extensive networks in law-enforcement bodies and among judicial authorities.\nFurthermore, the case file contains sufficient evidence showing that [the applicant] avoided appearing before the investigation authorities, that he travels abroad regularly and that he is absent from his registered address. That being so, if at liberty, he will abscond or hinder the investigation and the implementation of procedural decisions.\nTherefore, the application of any other preventive measure in respect of the accused ... will not be able to ensure his proper procedural conduct and the fulfilment of procedural decisions...\u201d",
                "26.  On the same day the Pecherskyy Court found that the case file did not contain sufficient information about the applicant in order to take a decision on the investigator\u2019s application. In particular, the file did not contain sufficient information about the applicant\u2019s health, family and financial situation or his occupation. The court therefore extended the applicant\u2019s preliminary detention to ten days as a temporary preventive measure. The decision was not subject to appeal.",
                "27.  On 30 December 2010 the Pecherskyy Court allowed the investigator\u2019s application (see paragraph 25 above) as well-founded and ordered the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention. The court further held that that finding rendered it unnecessary to examine alternative preventive measures. It rejected the applicant\u2019s complaint about his arrest as unsubstantiated.",
                "28.  On 2 January 2011 the applicant appealed. He reiterated his earlier arguments on the alleged unlawfulness of his arrest by the investigator (see paragraph 24 above). Furthermore, he complained that the Pecherskyy Court had failed to justify the application of what was the most intrusive preventive measure available in his case. He argued that the court had not taken into account the fact that he was the sole breadwinner for his three children and his wife and that their newborn child was still in hospital. Positive character references and his requests for a non-custodial preventive measure had also been disregarded.",
                "29.  On 4 January 2011 the President of the Ukrainian Bar Association applied to the Court of Appeal, offering his personal surety for the applicant\u2019s release. In the alternative, he indicated that he was ready to pay bail for the applicant.",
                "30.  On 13 January 2011 the Court of Appeal rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal and upheld the findings and reasoning of the Pecherskyy Court\u2019s decision of 30 December 2010. There was no reference in the ruling to the application by the Bar Association President.",
                "31.  On 31 January 2011 the applicant was additionally charged with forging an official document under Article 366 \u00a7 2 of the CC (see paragraph 40 below).",
                "32.  On the same day the pre-trial investigation was declared completed and the applicant was given access to the case file.",
                "33.  On 10 February 2011 the Pecherskyy Court extended the applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention to three months, finding that there were no grounds to change the preliminary measure to a more lenient one.",
                "34.  On 15 February 2011 the investigator released the applicant under an undertaking not to abscond. The change of preventive measure was explained by the fact that the applicant could no longer influence witnesses or impede the investigation. The investigator also made a general reference to the applicant\u2019s age, state of health, family and financial situation, as well as the fact that he had children to care for, permanent employment and positive character references.",
                "35.  As known from public available material, some media outlets linked the applicant\u2019s release to a private meeting between his father-in-law as the President of the Supreme Court and the President of Ukraine a day earlier, on 14 February 2011. The applicant publicly denied those rumours.",
                "36.  The parties did not inform the Court of any further developments in the criminal proceedings against the applicant. Publicly available material shows that he was amnestied in December 2011."

                "20.  On 12 July 2012 the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud) dismissed the applicants\u2019 constitutional appeal, considering that there was no violation of Article 6 as res iudicata was indeed a procedural obstacle which prevented further proceedings. It further held that the applicants\u2019 dissatisfaction with the costs awarded in the criminal proceedings did not mean that they could claim them by a regular civil claim (putem redovne gra\u0111anske tu\u017ebe). In any event, the civil proceedings could not serve to correct the final decisions issued in criminal proceedings.",

Some victims, as well as other witnesses who had arrived at the scene immediately after the shooting, stated that there had been no street lighting and that visibility had been considerably impaired. The investigating judge also heard oral evidence from M.M., who had sold the car used in the incident to two people whom he didn\u2019t know and \u201cwould not recognise if I (he) were to see them now\u201d. He stated that a certain F. had introduced him to the buyers.",
                "9.  During the investigation, there were several unsuccessful attempts by the investigating judge to summons B.H. Assistance from the police was also sought. Having been alerted to the summons and the police inquiry, B.H. appeared in court to testify before the investigating judge. On 27 February and 23 March 2007 he confirmed that he had been present at the scene at the time of the incident and that he had been shot in the upper leg. He had fainted and had spent time recovering in a private hospital outside the respondent State. He stated that there had been four people in the car and that all had fired on the caf\u00e9. He identified a certain Dz. as the driver of the car. He also alleged that he himself had been the most likely target of the attack owing to his alleged involvement in the killing of the applicants\u2019 brother, which had happened at the beginning of 2006. In that context, he had received threats that he would be killed.",
                "10.  On 4 May 2007 two people who had been eye-witnesses to the incident gave oral evidence in the presence of the investigating judge and the public prosecutor. They testified as anonymous witnesses (\u0441\u0432\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043a \u0441\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0440\u0438\u0435\u043d \u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442) under the pseudonyms \u201cKorab\u201d and \u201cVodno\u201d.

                "11.  On photographs shown in evidence, both witnesses identified one of the applicants as having fired on the caf\u00e9 and Dz. as the driver of the car. \u201cVodno\u201d also identified the other applicant as having fired on the caf\u00e9. He stated that three people (including the applicants) had fired weapons in the incident of 18 May 2006.",
                "12.  On 11 May 2007 another individual was examined before the investigating judge and the public prosecutor under the pseudonym \u201cVardar\u201d for the same reasons as the witness \u201cVodno\u201d. He confirmed that Mr Ramiz Asani (the applicant) had bought the car used in the accident from M.M. He also stated that after the incident Mr Ramiz Asani had told him the following:\n\u201cwhat you\u2019ve seen and heard on television about the incident with M.M.\u2019s car \u2013 I did it in revenge for the killing of my brother ...\u201d",
                "13.  On the same date, the investigating judge opened an investigation against the applicants and Dz. on reasonable suspicion of murder. The applicants, who had in the meantime been arrested, were remanded in prison custody. On a later date the investigating judge suspended the investigation in respect of Dz. as he had proved to be untraceable.",

In an indictment of 13 August 2007, the public prosecutor accused the applicants \u2212 who had no previous record, but had criminal proceedings in relation to other charges pending against them \u2212 of having fired machine guns at the Internet caf\u00e9 with the intention of killing B.H. The prosecutor requested that the trial judge examine the victims and several witnesses \u2212 including B.H. and M.M., and the anonymous witnesses \u2212 and to admit other material evidence in evidence, including post-mortem reports and other expert reports.",
                "15.  At the trial, the applicants, represented by two lawyers, unsuccessfully requested that evidence produced by the anonymous witnesses be rejected and that the written transcripts of their depositions be excluded from the case file. The trial judge, however, granted their request for witnesses \u201cKorab\u201d and \u201cVodno\u201d to be questioned at the trial. The examination was carried out at a hearing of 21 January 2008 in the presence of only the trial judge and the public prosecutor, as provided for in the Criminal Procedure Act in force at the time (see paragraph 24 below). Both witnesses repeated the statements they had given before the investigating judge and reiterated their fear of negative repercussions. Their statements were read out at the trial in the presence of the applicants. A written transcript of their depositions was communicated to the applicants who, at their request, obtained a ten-day grace period in which to prepare written questions to be put to these witnesses by the court. The applicants formulated seven questions to be put to each witness. Both witnesses replied, again in the presence of only the trial judge and the public prosecutor. \u201cKorab\u201d stated that only one person had fired, while according to \u201cVodno\u201d three people had fired at the caf\u00e9. Both witnesses submitted that, despite the impaired visibility, there had been sufficient light to see the applicants. A transcript of their replies was communicated to the applicants.",
                "16.  The trial judge further examined M.M., who did not recognise Mr Ramiz Asani as the buyer of the car used in the incident. He also heard oral evidence from three of 25 witnesses proposed by the applicants regarding their whereabouts at the time when the crime was committed. All three witnesses corroborated the applicants\u2019 version of events, namely that they had been in another local caf\u00e9 at that time.",
                "17.  Since the identity of witness \u201cVardar\u201d had been disclosed in the proceedings (F.S.), the trial judge granted the applicants\u2019 request for him to be questioned again. At a hearing held on 1 April 2008 in the presence of the applicants, F.S. denied that he had testified as an anonymous witness. He denied that the applicants had bought the car from M.M. He alleged that he had been beaten by the police in order to tell the investigating judge that the applicants had bought the car (see paragraph 12 above).",
                "18.  At the same hearing, the trial judge read out B.H.\u2019s pre-trial statement (see paragraph 9 above). The judge did so after having tried on several occasions to secure his attendance at the trial and having inquired with the police about his whereabouts. It was noted that, according to official notes in the case file, B.H. was untraceable. The record of the hearing did not specify that the applicants objected to the reading of the statement.",
                "19.  During the proceedings, the trial judge granted the applicants\u2019 request for a face-to-confrontation with the experts who had carried out the ballistic examination. He did not, however, allow an additional ballistic examination and refused to admit further evidence regarding the intensity of the street lighting at the scene at the relevant time (the applicants alleged that the street light had been too low to allow the anonymous witnesses to see the assailants). In their concluding remarks, the applicants claimed that B.H. was in the respondent State and had been involved in incidents relating to the parliamentary elections of 1 June 2008.",
                "20.  On 23 June 2008 the trial court delivered a judgment in which it found the applicants guilty of murder and sentenced them to life imprisonment. The applicants\u2019 presence at the scene when the incident happened, as well as the development and dynamics of events, was established on the basis of the testimony of the anonymous witnesses \u201cKorab\u201d and \u201cVodno\u201d, which the court regarded as credible and consistent despite \u201csmall differences which were due to the intensity of the shooting and fear for their lives\u201d. The court also gave weight to the statement given by F.S. in the pre-trial proceedings under the pseudonym \u201cVardar\u201d. It disregarded his statement of 1 April 2008 (see paragraph 17 above), finding that it had been given under duress and the threat that he or his family would be killed. In this connection it referred to a police report of 24 January 2008 according to which F.S. had been visited several times by unknown people who had threatened him and his family about the testimony given in the pre-trial proceedings. The motive for the crime was established on the basis of the statement given by B.H. in the pre-trial proceedings. That witness had not been examined at the trial since he had been untraceable. In that context, the trial court referred to an official note by the police of 9 January 2008 informing the court that B.H. had fled the respondent State and that an arrest warrant (\u043f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430) had been issued against him. The court did not say anything regarding the applicants\u2019 allegations that B.H. had in fact been in the respondent State and could have been located (see paragraph 19 above). In the court\u2019s view, the evidence produced by the defence witnesses was unreliable and aimed at enabling the accused to avoid criminal responsibility. For this reason it considered it irrelevant to examine the remaining witnesses proposed by the defence. The applicants\u2019 defence that they had been at another location at the relevant time was found to be self\u2011serving.",
                "21.  In public hearings held on 10 October 2008 and 25 September 2009 (latter judgment served on the applicant on 5 January 2010) respectively, the Skopje Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court upheld the applicants\u2019 conviction and the sentence imposed on them. They dismissed appeals lodged by the applicants in which they complained inter alia that the trial court had failed to admit evidence proposed by the defence, that their conviction could not be based solely on the statements of the anonymous witnesses, which had been unlawfully obtained, and that the trial court had not examined B.H. notwithstanding their claims that he would have been available for examination. In this connection they argued that it had been an issue of public record that in the election incidents of 1 June 2008 B.H. had been wounded and hospitalised and later detained by the police.",
                "22.  The courts held that the evidence produced by the anonymous witnesses had been lawfully obtained and that the applicants\u2019 opportunity to put written questions to them had secured their defence rights. The fact that the witnesses had only produced evidence a year after the incident had been due to their fear. Furthermore, they stated that the applicants\u2019 conviction had not been based solely on the evidence produced by those witnesses. In this connection they found that the trial court had admitted other evidence, both documentary and verbal. As regards the evidence produced by B.H., the courts held that the trial court had tried to secure his attendance at the trial, but he had been unavailable for examination, as described in the police note. The higher courts also endorsed the trial court\u2019s finding regarding the applicants\u2019 motive for committing the crime, as established on the basis of the evidence produced by B.H. That had been confirmed by the pre-trial statement of witness F.S. given under pseudonym \u201cVardar\u201d (see paragraph 12 above).",
                "23.  On 2 December 2010 Dz. was found and detained. In subsequent criminal proceedings, he was convicted of murder and sentenced to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment."

The relevant decision reads as follows:\n\u201cOn 16 January 2008 the Komsomolskiy District Court of Kerson ... established:\nThe criminal case concerning the accusation of [the applicant] under Article 368 paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine is pending before the Komsomolskiy District Court of Kherson.\nThe prosecutor requested that the preventive measure against [the applicant] be changed in view of the fact that [the applicant], using publications in ... newspaper, is putting pressure on witnesses in the case (K. and A.) who have not yet been questioned by the trial court. [This] could affect the truthfulness of their testimony and their appearance before the court. In the hearing, the prosecutor further provided additional evidence to confirm the fact of [the applicant\u2019s] putting pressure on I., a witness, and the victim, Ya.\nHaving heard the prosecutor\u2019s explanations, as well as [the applicant] and his lawyers, the court finds that the application has to be allowed on the following grounds.\n[The applicant] is accused of having committed a crime under Article 386 paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine. The sanction established for the crime is imprisonment for the period from five to nine years. On 27 July 2007 bail ... was chosen as a preventive measure in respect of [the applicant].\nPursuant to Article 148 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, preventive measures shall be applied to a defendant with the aim of preventing attempts ... to obstruct the truth from being established in a criminal case. ... Preventive measures shall be applied if there are sufficient grounds to consider that the defendant will try to abscond from the trial or obstruct the truth from being established in a case.\n[The applicant] has no criminal record, has committed a serious crime linked to his professional activity as the head of Khorol Village Council, is currently removed from his position and accordingly is not able to continue his criminal activity, [and] is well thought of at his place of work and place of residence. However, the court believes that [the applicant], acting through unidentified individuals, has taken steps aimed at obstructing the truth from being established in the case in the course of the court\u2019s consideration of his case.\nThus, according to statements of 28 December 2007 made by the victim, Ya., and I., a witness, unknown individuals acting on [the applicant\u2019s] behalf, have put psychological pressure on them, trying to prevent their appearing at the hearing of 29 December 2007.\nThe above-mentioned fact is evidence of a breach by [the applicant] of his undertakings.\nBearing in mind that the court proceedings in the criminal case are still ongoing, that K. and A., witnesses, have not yet been questioned, and that there may be a need for additional questioning of I., a witness, and Ya., the victim, the court believes that the prosecutor\u2019s application is well-founded and should be granted in order to prevent further possible pressure [being put] on the witnesses and the victim, and thus to eliminate obstacles to establishing the truth in the case ...\nGiven what has been stated above, ... the court rules to change the preventive measure in respect of [the applicant] ... \u201d",

                "8.  On 24 December 2010 the applicants were brought before an investigating judge of the Skopje Court of First Instance (\u041e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d \u0441\u0443\u0434 \u0421\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0458\u0435, \u201cthe trial court\u201d).

It was alleged that the first applicant had conspired to create an organised group for the commission of various criminal offences through a network of companies founded and owned by the suspects.",
                "9.  At the same time the investigating judge ordered that nineteen of the suspects, including the applicants, be held in pre-trial detention for thirty days. The order also applied to five suspects who were still at large, including H.R., the son of the first applicant and brother of the second applicant. The order was based on all three grounds specified in section 199(1) of the Criminal Proceedings Act (\u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043f\u043a\u0430, Official Gazette no. 15/2005 \u2013 \u201cthe Act\u201d), namely a risk of the suspects absconding, reoffending and interfering with the investigation. As to the risk of absconding, the judge took into account the statements of the suspects, including the fact that some of them had decided to remain silent, the gravity of the charges and the severity of the anticipated penalty, and concluded that there was a risk of the suspects absconding if they were released. Detaining the suspects on the grounds of the risk of their reoffending was justified by the fact that most of them held managerial posts in companies implicated in the criminal proceedings and had authority to sign business accounts and other financial documents. The judge further held that special circumstances (\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438) suggested that if released, the suspects might interfere with the investigation by influencing prosecution witnesses who were to be examined by the investigating judge. The preparation of a financial expert report was also ordered.",
                "10.  On 21 January 2011 a three-judge panel of the trial court set up under section 22(6) of the Act (see paragraph 33 below) ordered a thirty-day extension of the pre-trial detention of the applicants and twelve other suspects on all three grounds specified under the Act. As to the risk of their absconding, the panel reasoned as follows:\n\u201cThe material and verbal evidence adduced so far corroborates the reasonable suspicion that the defendants have committed the crimes of which they are suspected. Having regard to the nature, character and type of offences that are being investigated, as well as the gravity of the charges, the level of criminal responsibility, the anticipated penalty ... the panel considers that there is a real risk of flight if the defendants are released ... The risk of flight is further reinforced by the financial circumstances of the defendants, given the fact that most of them do not have immovable property in their name ... The panel has taken into consideration the fact that most of the defendants have families and that they are parents, as well as that [some of the defendants, including Ms E. Ramkovska] have immovable property in their name, but these circumstances do not eliminate the risk of the defendants absconding and are insufficient to secure their attendance at the pre-trial proceedings.\u201d",
                "11.  The panel also considered that, if released, the suspects might interfere with the investigation. In this connection, it took note of the fact that the examination of prosecution witnesses had been scheduled for 21, 25 and 31 January 2011. The fact that some of the suspects (but not the applicants) had decided to remain silent was considered by the panel as a factor that heightened the risk of interference with the investigation.",
                "12.  As regards the risk of reoffending, the panel took into account that the applicants were suspected of being part of an organised group that had been operating over a prolonged period of time, with assigned roles in business structures of already existing companies or companies which the suspects aimed to establish with a view to making unlawful gains. The fact that the suspects still held the same posts in the companies implicated in the criminal proceedings implied a risk of reoffending, if they were released.",
                "13.  On 26 January 2011 the applicants lodged appeals complaining that the three-judge panel had not given concrete reasons to justify their pre-trial detention. They argued that the panel had not provided sufficient reasons to justify detaining them on grounds of the risk of their reoffending, and that the risk of interference with the investigation had not been substantiated since nearly all the evidence had already been gathered. The fact that some of the other suspects had decided to remain silent could not serve as basis for extending their pre-trial detention. The applicants also submitted that they did not have a previous criminal record; they had not resisted arrest and had behaved in an exemplary manner during their detention. Both of them had families and possessions in the respondent State. The second applicant was a mother of three minor children. They sought release and replacement of the detention order with a more lenient measure, such as house arrest.",
                "14.  On 4 February 2011 the Skopje Court of Appeal (\u0410\u043f\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0435\u043d \u0441\u0443\u0434 \u0421\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0458\u0435, \u201cthe Court of Appeal\u201d) dismissed the appeals of the applicants and the other suspects and upheld the court order. As regards the risk of interference with the investigation, the Court of Appeal held that the investigation had not yet been completed and the examination of the witnesses was ongoing. The court relied on the gravity of the charges and the severity of the penalty to justify detaining them on the grounds of the risk of their absconding. As to the risk of reoffending, the Court of Appeal reiterated the panel\u2019s finding that the suspects were being investigated for acting as an organised group over a prolonged period of time, through a network of companies founded at home and abroad, with a view to making unlawful gains.",
                "15.  On 21 February 2011 a three-judge panel of the trial court ordered another thirty-day extension of the pre-trial detention of the applicants and nine other suspects. The panel used identical wording to justify detaining them on the grounds of the risk of the suspects absconding, reoffending and interfering with the investigation. Additionally, the panel took into consideration the fact that the investigation had been extended to include additional criminal offences. Thus additional evidence, including the examination of two witnesses \u2013 M.N. and R.D. as representatives of certain companies \u2013 was yet to be secured.",
                "16.  On 4 March 2011 the Court of Appeal dismissed appeals lodged by the applicants and the other suspects. It upheld the panel\u2019s decision and its reasoning justifying further extension of the applicants\u2019 pre-trial detention.",
                "17.  On 22 March 2011 the applicants and the other suspects were indicted before the trial court. Both applicants were charged with money laundering, criminal conspiracy and tax evasion. The first applicant was further charged with abuse of office.",
                "18.  On the same day a three-judge panel of the trial court ordered another thirty-day extension of the pre-trial detention of the applicants and other accused. The extension was ordered on grounds of the risk of the accused absconding and reoffending. The panel provided the following reasoning:\n\u201cThe material and verbal evidence adduced so far corroborates the high degree of reasonable suspicion that the accused have committed the crimes with which they are charged. Having regard to the nature, character and type of offences with which the accused are charged under the indictment; given that the accused committed the criminal offences as a well-organised and compact group consisting of organisers and members with assigned roles in taking the incriminated actions they are suspected of; having regard to the degree of danger for society and criminal responsibility; having regard to the type and severity of the anticipated penalty for the type of offences of which the accused are suspected, including the possibility of an effective prison sentence, the panel considers that there is a real risk of flight if the accused are released ... The risk of flight is increased if the behaviour of H.R., N.R., R.I. and R.C [other accused] is taken into consideration given that they remain unavailable to the law-enforcement authorities ...\nIn the assessment of the risk of reoffending as a ground warranting further extension of the pre-trial detention, the panel took into account the nature and type of the offences with which the accused were charged ... and the fact that the defendants are accused of acting as a well-organised group, consisting of organisers and members, with assigned roles in the business structures of several companies, that acted over a prolonged period of time. The risk of reoffending is reinforced due to the circumstance that some of the criminal offences were committed as continuous crimes, which underlines the nature and character [of the accused], as well as their susceptibility to carry out criminal activities of this type over a prolonged period of time. The fact that the majority of the accused still occupy the same posts in the companies involved in the criminal proceedings, from which they took the incriminated actions of which they are accused in the criminal proceedings at hand, generates a risk of reoffending if the accused are released ...\u201d",
                "19.  On 28 March 2011 the applicants lodged appeals complaining that the court order violated their rights under Article 5 of the Convention, in that it did not provide concrete reasons for their detention. They argued that the panel had essentially issued a collective detention order, using identical wording and standardised phrases without specifying any particular reason concerning the applicants\u2019 personal character that would justify their pre-trial detention. They also argued that the wording used by the panel was in violation of the principle of presumption of innocence guaranteed under Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the Convention.",
                "20.  On 11 April 2011 the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeals of the applicants and the other accused. It relied on the gravity of the charges and the severity of the anticipated penalty as circumstances warranting further extension of the pre-trial detention of the applicants and the other accused. With regard to the risk of reoffending, the Court of Appeal took note of the fact that the defendants were accused of acting as an organised group over a prolonged period of time, with pre-defined roles, using the established business structure of companies in the respondent State and abroad.",
                "21.  On 21 April 2011 a three-judge panel of the trial court ordered another thirty-day extension of the pre-trial detention of the applicants and other accused on the grounds that they might abscond and reoffend. It provided the same reasons as before.",

                "23.  On 10 May 2011 the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeals of the applicants and the other accused, providing the same reasoning as before.",
                "24.  On 13 May 2011 that decision was served on the first applicant in prison. On the same day the applicants\u2019 lawyer inspected the case file in the trial court.",
                "25.  In the meantime, the applicants unsuccessfully applied for release on several occasions. On 10 May 2011 a three-judge panel of the trial court dismissed an application for release submitted by the second applicant. It also removed the risk of reoffending from the list of grounds justifying the second applicant\u2019s pre-trial detention.",
                "26.  In the course of the proceedings the applicants\u2019 pre-trial detention was continuously extended until their conviction by the trial court. The first applicant\u2019s detention was extended on the grounds that he might abscond and reoffend. After 10 May 2011 the second applicant\u2019s detention was extended solely on grounds that she might abscond.",
                "27.  On 14 March 2012 the trial court convicted the applicants as charged. The court further decided that they would remain in custody until the judgment became final.",
                "28.  On 25 February 2013 the Court of Appeal upheld the applicants\u2019 conviction. The applicants have started to serve their prison sentences.",

On 2 December 2014 the Russian Ministry of Justice issued an exclusion order, declaring the applicant\u2019s presence in Russia undesirable and prohibiting his return to Russia until 2020. Further to the exclusion order, on 4 March 2015 the migration authorities issued a deportation order in respect of the applicant and he was later arrested. On 6 March 2015 a judge authorised his further detention until 10 March 2015, with a view to enforcing the deportation order. His detention was then extended until 30 August 2015.",

On 14 December 2015 the applicant was accused of an offence under Article 18.8 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Administrative Offences (CAO) on account of his presence in Russia without the necessary documents. On 15 December 2015 the Kirovskiy District Court of Saint Petersburg convicted the applicant and ordered his administrative removal from Russia (without specifying the destination country). The judge noted that the applicant was a stateless person but held that he had to comply with a statutory obligation to leave Russia, having no valid legal basis for being there. Lastly, the judge ordered that the applicant be placed in a detention centre for foreigners, with a view to enforcing his administrative removal.",

                "12.  On 26 January 2016 the Saint Petersburg City Court upheld the judgment of 15 December 2015. The appeal court considered that the applicant could still be removed to the country from which he had arrived in Russia if there was a readmission agreement with that country; that he could be held in detention for a maximum of two years, which was the statutory period for the enforceability of a penalty; and that the CAO had not required the trial judge to set any time-limit when ordering his placement in a detention centre for foreigners.",

There was no proper, ceramic toilet bowl, just a \u201chole\u201d with a flusher set on a small base so the toilet had to be used in a squatting position. According to the applicant, the partition was not high enough and the toilet area remained visible. There were also unpleasant odours.",

He submitted that his waiver of his right to legal assistance had not been unequivocal, which had been proven by the fact that he had requested a lawyer before the Public Prosecutor, as soon as his police custody ended. He further contested the relevance of the DNA examination with regard to the tile-cutting machine, arguing that the court should conduct an examination of the wooden club indicated in his police statements, in order to prove that his confessions had not been genuine.",
                "24.  On 16 October 2003 the Gebze Assize Court held that it lacked jurisdiction and forwarded the case to the Kocaeli Juvenile Court as the applicant had been a minor at the time of the murder. During the course of the thirteen hearings before it, the Assize Court obtained a report from the Istanbul Forensics Institute and heard all the police officers involved in the applicant\u2019s questioning. It further examined two witnesses, namely, the owners of the jewellery stores described by the applicant, who stated that they had not seen him before.",
                "25.  During the course of the hearings before the Juvenile Court, the applicant requested the court to obtain a new forensics report, claiming that there were discrepancies between the police report and that prepared by the Istanbul Forensics Institute, as the latter noted that no blood sample could be found on either the tile-cutting machine or the wooden club. The court rejected that request. Nevertheless, it re-examined and accepted the applicant\u2019s request to have the appointed lawyer heard. In his statements before the court, that lawyer submitted that he had first seen the applicant during the interview at the Public Prosecutor\u2019s office and had suspected that he might have been ill-treated as he had been nervous. The court also heard a number of other witnesses, including his friend A.S., who indicated that the applicant had spent a considerable amount of money in \u0130zmir.",
                "26.  In his submissions before the Juvenile Court, the applicant maintained that he had not been assigned a lawyer while in police custody and claimed that he had been coerced into making a false confession although he had not committed the murder. He added that he had withdrawn the money he had spent after the events with his father\u2019s debit card. Following that latter submission, the court obtained the transcripts of the applicant\u2019s father\u2019s bank account, which showed no such transaction.",
                "27.  On 31 May 2004 the Juvenile Court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to twenty-six years and eight months\u2019 imprisonment. The court noted that it did not take account of the statements made by the applicant during his questioning by the police, as in any event it found him guilty on the basis of his subsequent statements confessing his acts, the records of the reconstruction of events, the forensics reports, the statements of A.S., and the bank transcripts which rebutted his defence with regard to the money he had spent after the murder.",
                "28.  The applicant appealed against the judgment, arguing that he might have made contradictory remarks as he had been confused with the questions of the judges. Reiterating his submissions with regard to his alleged ill-treatment, he maintained that he had not been assigned a lawyer while in police custody although he had requested one.",
                "29.  On 16 June 2005 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment, finding that the applicant\u2019s sentence needed to be re-evaluated in the light of the new Penal Code, which had entered into force following the judgment.",
                "30.  On 27 July 2005 the Juvenile Court sentenced the applicant to a total of twenty-one years\u2019 imprisonment. On 12 October 2006 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment once again, this time as a result of the Juvenile Court\u2019s failure to hold a hearing while re-evaluating the sentence.",
                "31.  On 15 February 2007, after holding a hearing and assessing the applicant\u2019s final submissions, the Juvenile Court sentenced him to twenty-one years\u2019 imprisonment for murder and robbery. That judgment was upheld by the Court of Cassation on 19 July 2007."

The police report stated that the applicant had been \u201charassing an underage teenager\u201d without providing a detailed account of the events. It is not clear from the material available to the Court whether the intervention by the police had been triggered by any complaint from that teenager or any other person.",

[and] stalking an underage teenager and not allowing him to walk away [from such encounters] ...\nMentally alert. Aware of his surroundings. Unwilling to engage in contact.

Selective in answering questions, answers [only] after some pause. Asks for some time to \u201cspend with boys\u201d. Distracted. Not reflective [about his mental state]. Diagnosis: schizotypal disorder.\u201d",
                "11.  On 25 April 2014 the applicant was examined jointly by the attending psychiatrist and the head of one of the Hospital\u2019s departments. They made the following record:\n\u201cFollow-up patient history: According to the patient, about three years ago [in 2011] he started feeling the desire to be in contact with boys, to look like a girl. He dyed his hair to attract attention. He started watching television shows to observe how a woman moves; he uses make-up, dresses up. Since the beginning of last year he has become fixated on these thoughts, and started contemplating the possibility of gender reassignment. During this period he has had mood swings, has been anxious, irritable, [and had] difficulties in focusing his attention. Given these circumstances he was hospitalised in [a psychiatric facility]. After his discharge his condition improved. He continued his studies. In the past year he has started paying more attention to his appearance, using lipstick, wearing women\u2019s jewellery, [and has] sometimes tried on women\u2019s clothing at home. He became acquainted with a boy, a ninth grade student, during one of his walks in the city. He started meeting him, talking to him, tried to \u2018have physical contact\u2019, touched his hand, fondled it. Had a desire to be \u2018caressed\u2019.\nAccording to the supporting documents \u2013 [a report to the head of the police station, the order for a psychiatric ambulance] \u2013 he was apprehended by police officers on the street, where he had been sexually harassing an underage teenager, having stalked him for four months, repeatedly not allowing him to walk away from such encounters. Transferred to [the police station] where he was examined by a psychiatrist on duty, subsequently involuntarily admitted [to the psychiatric hospital] ... During his examination in the reception ward he signed [a document consenting] to treatment ...\nPsychiatric state: Self-aware. Subdued mood. Somewhat distracted. Looks untidy, unkempt hair, dyed ginger. Soft, high-pitched voice. Indisposed to conversation, replies [only] after some pause, does not answer certain questions, asks for some questions to be repeated. While replying he gulps with an expression of pain. Excessive facial expressions during conversation. States that he feels uncontrollable attraction to boys, to be liked by them, to have contact with them. Requests a \u201cspace to meet with a boy\u201d. Blushes while saying this. Considers himself a \u201cfemale person\u201d. Considers in-patient treatment necessary for himself in order to improve his mood, reduce irritability and \u201cperplexity of thoughts\u201d. Denies hallucinations. Denies suicidal thoughts.\nDiagnosis: Schizotypal disorder.\u201d",
                "12.  On the same day the applicant, after conferring with his father, demanded to be discharged from the Hospital; however, his request was denied.",
                "13.  On the same day a medical counselling panel composed of the resident psychiatrists of the Hospital examined the applicant and diagnosed him with organic delusional disorder. The panel also found that the applicant was a danger to himself and others and that there was a risk of significant damage to his health due to the deterioration or aggravation of his psychiatric condition in the absence of psychiatric assistance. The full text of the panel\u2019s report and conclusion read as follows:\n\u201c25.04.2014 12.00 Panel examination due to refusal of treatment.\nLethargic, sluggish. Subdued mood. Attributes [the cause of] his subdued mood to [his] inability to meet up with a boy he is attracted to. Unsure whether that boy also is attracted to him. Goes across the city to see that \u2018boy\u2019. He wants to be \u2018treated gently, to be caressed, fondled\u2019. Admitted that he goes to women\u2019s clothing stores [because he likes the clothing], which is \u2018soft and bright\u2019. For a long time has been visiting the neighbourhood where he met the boy; previously he had been going to other neighbourhoods to watch boys.\nDiagnosis: Organic delusional disorder.\nConclusion: needs involuntary placement and treatment, in accordance with section 29(a) and (c) of the 1992 Psychiatric Assistance Act.\u201d",
                "14.  On the same day the Hospital applied for judicial authorisation of the applicant\u2019s involuntary hospitalisation under section 29(a) and (c) of the Psychiatric Assistance Act 1992, since the applicant was a danger to himself or others and there was a risk of significant damage to his health owing to the deterioration or aggravation of his psychiatric condition in the absence of psychiatric assistance. The application restated the findings of the earlier joint examination (see paragraph 11 above) and set out the following conclusions:\n\u201cOn 25 April 2014 was examined by the panel of resident psychiatrists of [the Hospital] and diagnosed with organic delusional disorder.\nThe patient needs to be involuntarily hospitalised and treated under section 29 (a) and (c) of the Psychiatric Assistance Act of 1992.\nThe examination and treatment of the patient can take place only under an in-patient regime ...\n[It is requested] 2.  That the request for authorisation be assessed on the premises of the Hospital, since because of his mental state [the applicant] cannot be produced in court ...\u201d",
                "15.  On 5 May 2014 the Savyolovskiy District Court of Moscow (\u0421\u0430\u0432\u0451\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0443\u0434 \u0433. \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u044b) held a hearing on the premises of the psychiatric facility. The hearing was attended by the applicant, his father and mother, the attending psychiatrist Mr P., the head of one of the Hospital\u2019s departments (Mr L.), the representative of the Hospital (Mrs K.) and the local prosecutor.",
                "16.  During the hearing Mr P., Mr L., and Mrs K. generally advanced the same arguments as those presented in the application for judicial authorisation (see paragraph 14 above), maintaining that the applicant needed to be hospitalised and treated, that he posed a danger to himself and others, and that there was a risk of significant damage to his health in the event of a deterioration in or aggravation of his psychiatric condition in the absence of psychiatric assistance. Mr P. also reported that the applicant considered himself to be healthy and refused treatment, while at the same time \u201cbeing confused, replying to questions with other questions, and being exceptionally insincere\u201d. They also emphasised the fact that the applicant had been apprehended by the police for sexually harassing an underage person.",
                "17.  The applicant\u2019s parents had conflicting opinions about the need for hospitalisation. The mother stated that the applicant did \u201cnot feel well\u201d and had been \u201cirritable lately\u201d, that her communication with him was restricted by the father and that she had not seen him since 10 February 2014. In her opinion, in-patient treatment was necessary. The applicant\u2019s father, acting as his representative, objected to involuntary hospitalisation and did not agree that his son posed any danger to himself or to others. He stated that Mr X was voluntarily following the treatment prescribed by a neurologist and a psychiatrist, that his condition showed signs of improvement and that hospitalisation would interfere with his studies and future career. In his opinion his son had only tried to become friends with \u201cthe boy\u201d, not sexually harass him. He furthermore stated that the police report referred to by the Hospital contained no information on the alleged sexual harassment or other unlawful acts.",
                "18.  The applicant stated the following during the hearing:\n\u201cI refuse treatment and feel myself to be well ... There is nothing special about me. I dyed my hair ginger because that colour suits me, I do not like black. I only wanted to become friends with that boy, nothing special; I tried no clothes on; that is all nonsense. [I want to finish my studies]; I have only two months left and I do not want to be in hospital. I made no statements concerning trying on womens\u2019 clothing or changing gender.\u201d",
                "19.  The District Court, having considered the above-mentioned statements, medical evidence, a police report, and the applicant\u2019s educational records, the same day authorised the applicant\u2019s involuntary hospitalisation. The authorisation issued by the court in a succinct manner stated that, while the applicant and his father objected to hospitalisation, the evidence presented by the medical panel of the Hospital demonstrated that the applicant was a danger to himself and others and that his mental state might deteriorate in the absence of treatment.",
                "20.  The applicant\u2019s father appealed. The statement of appeal indicated that the District Court had relied exclusively on the evaluation of the resident psychiatrists, had not addressed inconsistencies in evidence, had failed to substantiate the assertion that the applicant\u2019s condition was severe and that he posed a danger to himself or others, and, lastly, had failed to demonstrate the absence of any alternative treatment options.",
                "21.  On 20 May 2014 the applicant was discharged from the Hospital after an improvement in his mental state.",
                "22.  Certificates issued by the local police station in May 2014 stated that the applicant had not committed any administrative or criminal offence and that he had been referred to psychiatrists because of mental disorders.",
                "23.  On 18 July 2014 the appeal was dismissed by the Moscow City Court (\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0443\u0434). The relevant parts of the decision read as follows:\n\u201c... The case file shows that on 24 April 2014 [a policeman apprehended the applicant]. The police report indicates that [he] had been harassing underage persons ...\nSince the behaviour of [the applicant] exhibited symptoms of mental disorder, [he was taken to the Hospital], where he initially agreed to hospitalisation, stated that since 2013 [he had been subject to] mood changes, and that he [suffered from] anxiety, irritability and difficulties in focusing his attention. Previously he had been hospitalised in [a psychiatric facility]; following his discharge from [that facility] his mental state improved, [and] he had continued his studies. However during the last year the condition re-appeared.\n[According to the medical evidence] on 25 April 2014 [the applicant] was lethargic, sluggish, and had a subdued mood, which he attributed to his inability to meet up with a boy he is attracted to.\nDuring the hearing the representative of [the Hospital] stated that [the applicant] had been brought in in a delusional state, and had talked about \u2018a boy\u2019 who did not [in fact] exist. In this state he had been travelling long distances, presenting a danger to himself and others ...\nThe evidence [submitted to the first-instance court] substantiating the need for involuntary hospitalisation \u2013 including information on previous treatment for his delusional disorder and somatic condition (a second-degree disability) \u2013 constituted legal grounds for involuntary hospitalisation.\nSince the reaching of conclusions regarding the mental health of a person is within the exclusive competence of psychiatrists, the [district] court reasonably gave due regard to the report on the need to provide in-patient treatment to [the applicant] ...\nThe appeal does not refer to any factual information demonstrating that the relatives of [the applicant] or other persons are capable of ensuring his and other persons\u2019 safety without an in-patient treatment regime ...\u201d",
                "24.  The applicant\u2019s subsequent attempts to initiate a review of the above-mentioned judicial decisions proved unsuccessful."

On 28 January 2011 V.\u0160., a convicted prisoner, provided a statement to the Special Investigation Service (Speciali\u0173j\u0173 tyrim\u0173 tarnyba, hereinafter \u201cthe STT\u201d) and stated the following. He had heard from other inmates that the deputy head of Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Correctional Facility, L.D., took bribes to transfer inmates to units with lighter security and that L.D. had mentioned to V.\u0160. that it was possible to be released on probation for money. V.\u0160. was questioned by the STT and stated that in December 2010 L.D. had asked him to his office and enquired whether he wanted to be released early. L.D. had indicated that he had a friend who could help V.\u0160. obtain release on probation and promised to organise a meeting with him. V.\u0160. was asked again that month by L.D. to go to the latter\u2019s office, where he met the applicant (see paragraph 7 below). V.\u0160. asked the applicant what he should do in order to obtain release on probation. The applicant stated that V.\u0160. would first have to be transferred to a unit with lighter security. V.\u0160. asked the applicant how much it would cost him and the applicant replied that Kai\u0161iadorys [District Court] would cost him 7,000 Lithuanian litai (LTL, approximately 2,027 euros (EUR)). After that the applicant indicated several judges that would agree to release V.\u0160. on probation. The applicant also stated that the cost for the same thing in the Kaunas Regional Court would be approximately LTL 10,000 (approximately EUR 2,896) but that that was not the final amount. The applicant also mentioned that V.\u0160. would have to pay LTL 1,000 (approximately EUR 290) for the transfer to a unit with lower security. After that conversation V.\u0160. started recording his discussions with L.D. and the applicant using a voice recorder watch which he said he had obtained from other inmates in exchange for cigarettes. Figures mentioned during the other meetings were LTL 2,000 (approximately EUR 579) for the transfer to another unit and LTL 12,000 (approximately EUR 3,475) for the judges at the Kaunas Regional Court as that amount could be more easily divided in three than LTL 10,000. V.\u0160. stated that no agreement on legal services had been concluded with the applicant. V.\u0160. then contacted an acquaintance, G.T., a former police officer who promised to contact the authorities.",
                "7.  The transcript of the conversation recorded between V.\u0160. and the applicant on 26 January 2011 showed that V.\u0160. had around LTL 35,000 (approximately EUR 10,137). The conversation went as follows:\n\u201cThe applicant: \u2018 ...You understand that the intermediary who will go will also need some, and..\u2019\n...\nThe applicant: \u2018You know, salaries there are [LTL] 7,000, so you know...\u2019\nThe applicant: \u2018As with [D], when he brought, looked, he went there with those pennies, [they] said no, and he did not have any more...\u2019 V.\u0160.: \u2018Listen, I will be honest, for example I said, the deputy head asked me, asked. I told him that I will have ten, ten euros, so to say thirty five litai.\u2019\nThe applicant: \u2018... With that, we can easily talk about Kaunas.\u2019\n...\nThe applicant: \u2018I believe you. I think that it will go through with such an amount of money.\u2019\u201d\nThe applicant told V.\u0160. that that amount might not actually be necessary. V.\u0160. then told the applicant that G.T. would contact him and give him LTL 2,000 (EUR 579). The applicant also told V.\u0160. that he had won a case against Lithuania at the Court and that he had not accepted a bribe in that case. The conversation went as follows:\n\u201cThe applicant: \u2018I have already been burnt and only got things straight in Strasbourg. I have won [in] the Strasbourg Court against Lithuania. I previously worked as a prosecutor.\u2019 V.\u0160.: \u2018The deputy did not tell me anything.\u2019\nThe applicant: \u2018I could go back to being a prosecutor. I have won a case against Lithuania in Strasbourg.\u2019 V.\u0160.: \u2018I will ... shake your hand. I can say ... that this seems unreal to me.\u2019\nThe applicant: \u2018... The prosecutor with a bribe... Strasbourg proved that it was a provocation. I proved it in Strasbourg. The proceedings [there] took eight years.\u2019\nThe applicant: \u2018It was nothing to do with a bribe .... I ... bought an apartment, I asked someone to give me a loan... He ... was in prison later. He was released... and became a snitch.\u2019 V.\u0160.: \u2018A friend\u2019.\nThe applicant: \u2018... He used to sleep at my mother\u2019s place... I don\u2019t know where he disappeared to. He will not die a natural death. I was not the only one he set up. Two judges in Kaunas as well.\u2019\n...\nThe applicant: \u2018And I won a case in Strasbourg later. The Supreme Court rehabilitated me.\u2019 V.\u0160.: \u2018Yes.\u2019\nThe applicant: \u2018The Grand Chamber of seventeen judges, the plenary session for criminal cases.\u2019\n...\nThe applicant: \u2018So look.

Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow.\u2019\u201d\nThe applicant asked V.\u0160. to make sure that G.T. did not tell anyone about the agreement and V.\u0160. assured him that G.T. would not ask any questions.",
                "8.  On 31 January the STT asked a prosecutor to apply to a pre-trial judge for authorisation for G.T. and V.\u0160. to offer and give a bribe to L.D. and the applicant, in accordance with the provisions of domestic law. The prosecutor also sought permission to make video and/or voice-recordings, to take pictures and to allow three officers to monitor L.D.\u2019s and the applicant\u2019s telephone conversations. The prosecutor also asked the Vilnius City Second District Court on the STT\u2019s behalf to authorise covert surveillance of the applicant and L.D. for two months. The STT additionally informed the prosecutor that a pre-trial investigation had been opened against L.D. and the applicant.",

On the same day the Vilnius City Second District Court authorised taps on the telephones of L.D., V.\u0160., G.T. and the applicant and allowed G.T. and V.\u0160. to perform actions which imitated criminal conduct for two months, until 31 March 2011. V.\u0160. was allowed to use various types of telecommunications and electronic network measures.",

                "15.  On 3 February 2011 V.\u0160. called the applicant and asked how matters were proceeding. The applicant said that he would call back, but later asked to call the following Tuesday. On 10 February 2011 V.\u0160. called the applicant and said that they would be in touch; he also asked if the applicant would pay him a visit and the applicant said that he would come at some point in the future. On 14 February 2014 V.\u0160. called the applicant and said that he had received a character reference from the psychologist and the applicant stated that he would be in touch. V.\u0160. then asked the applicant whether he should call him and the applicant said that he could call when the documents for his transfer to a unit with lighter security were ready. On 19 February 2011 V.\u0160. called the applicant and informed him that the documents for the court had already been prepared. The applicant stated that he would be in touch and would come to visit V.\u0160. because they could not talk on the telephone. The applicant said that V.\u0160. could call him the following Wednesday or Thursday but then decided that Wednesday would be the best day. On 1-3 March 2011 V.\u0160. called L.D. and complained that he could not reach the applicant and asked for help in finding him. On 3 March 2011 L.D. called a certain A. and asked him where the applicant was. A. told him that it was not the first time that the applicant had disappeared.",
                "16.  On 7 March 2011 L.D. called the applicant and said that people were looking for him. The applicant said that V.\u0160.\u2019s case was still in progress. L.D. asked the applicant to come and meet V.\u0160. and the applicant said that he had understood. V.\u0160. then called the applicant, who said he was going to visit him in a few hours and that they would talk in person. V.\u0160. again called the applicant later that day and asked whether he should bring the medical certificate to the meeting and the applicant said that he was already in the correctional facility. During the visit they discussed the fact that V.\u0160.\u2019s case had not yet been transferred to court. V.\u0160. asked whether the applicant still had the necessary access [in the Kaunas Regional Court]. The applicant confirmed that he did, that the person concerned was coming back from Austria the following Monday and that without that person the matter could not be settled there. The applicant asked whether V.\u0160. wanted him to participate in a hearing before the court of first instance and V.\u0160. said yes. Then they talked about someone else\u2019s situation and the applicant said that he knew the prosecutor and had bought him. The applicant further said that not every prosecutor could be bought but there were two he could buy. V.\u0160. said that he had LTL 30,000 (approximately EUR 8,689) and it did not matter for what [court] he had to pay. The applicant then asked V.\u0160. to speak quieter. He also asked V.\u0160. to call him from time to time. V.\u0160. asked whether he would have to pay something before the hearing in the Kai\u0161iadorys District Court and the applicant said he would not have to give much because the chances were fifty-fifty. The applicant also stated that the rest of the money would be held in reserve for Kaunas [Regional Court] and he would take LTL 1,000 for Kai\u0161iadorys [District Court]. Later in the same conversation he mentioned LTL 1,500 (approximately EUR 434). The applicant asked V.\u0160. to get in touch with his contact person, who was to call and meet the applicant in the evening. After the applicant had left the correctional facility V.\u0160. called him and told him that the papers had been sent to the court on the twenty-third. The applicant asked V.\u0160. to call him in an hour. When V.\u0160. called, the applicant told him that the hearing would take place on 23 March and that the applicant would participate in it; he also asked to call him in the evening.",
                "17.  On 9 March 2011 V.\u0160. called the applicant, who said that he would write him a message. On 14 March 2011 V.\u0160. called the applicant and they again discussed V.\u0160.\u2019s situation. On 17 March 2011 V.\u0160. called the applicant and the applicant said that they would keep in touch after the following Sunday, and V.\u0160. was asked to call on Monday after lunch. On 18 March 2011 V.\u0160. called the applicant, who said that he would not participate in the hearing at the court of first instance regarding V.\u0160.\u2019s release on probation and that if something happened he would inform V.\u0160. On 21 March 2011 V.\u0160. called the applicant, who confirmed his intention as regards the court of first instance because he did not expect anything good to come out of it. However, he said he would try to talk to someone and V.\u0160. said he would not forget his debt to the applicant. On 23 March 2011 V.\u0160. called the applicant and informed him that the Kai\u0161iadorys District Court had decided not to release him on probation. The applicant then said that he would visit V.\u0160. so he could sign an appeal. On 23 March 2011 V.\u0160. called L.D. and asked him to ask the applicant about his chances to be released on probation. L.D. called the applicant the same day and asked how matters were proceeding with their client. The applicant said that he would come on Friday and that they would talk then. On 25 March 2011 the applicant visited V.\u0160., who signed some blank pieces of paper, on which the applicant said he would later write an appeal. V.\u0160. asked whether they would be covered by the amount they had discussed before. The applicant said that he would see, that he had talked with the men in question and asked them to do everything and that they would receive some money. V.\u0160. then told the applicant that his contact person would come the following Monday. After that, they discussed amounts and the applicant told V.\u0160. that the entire sum discussed would be necessary. V.\u0160. asked whether they were talking about thirty [thousand] and whether that amount included the applicant\u2019s share and the applicant said it did. The applicant also said that before that amount would have guaranteed his release on probation one hundred percent but that now there was some trouble. The applicant then told V.\u0160. to call his contact person and ask him to meet the applicant on Monday. V.\u0160. asked whether his person (G.T.) should bring thirty (thousand) and the applicant confirmed that he should.",
                "18.  On 29 March 2011 the applicant and G.T. met in the applicant\u2019s car, where LTL 30,000 was given to the applicant so that he could secure V.\u0160.\u2019s release on probation. The applicant was arrested by STT officers immediately afterwards and the money was found in the side door pocket of the applicant\u2019s car.",
                "19.  V.\u0160. was questioned additionally on 30 March 2011. He stated that L.D. had talked of the applicant as a reliable person who had access to prosecutors and judges. V.\u0160. also showed that L.D. had been the first one to start a conversation about the possibility of V.\u0160. being released on probation and that L.D. had told him several times before that \u201cserious men pay money and are released and do not sit in prison\u201d (rimti vyrai moka pinigus ir eina \u012f laisv\u0119, o ne s\u0117di kal\u0117jime).",
                "20.  On 8 April 2011 the Kaunas Regional Court dismissed V.\u0160.\u2019s appeal and upheld the first-instance decision not to release him on probation.",
                "21.  On 9 August 2011 a bill of indictment was drawn up against L.D. and the applicant. The applicant was accused of promising to influence L.D. and the judges at the Kai\u0161iadorys District Court and the Kaunas Regional Court with a bribe so that V.\u0160. would be released on probation. He was also accused of taking a bribe of LTL 2,000 and LTL 30,000 respectively on two occasions.",
                "22.  On 31 August 2011 the Court of Appeal examined an application by the prosecutor to transfer the criminal case from the Kai\u0161iadorys District Court. The Court of Appeal held that the applicant had stated that he could influence two judges in Kai\u0161iadorys and thus decided to transfer the case to the K\u0117dainiai District Court so that the proceedings would be fair.",
                "23.  On 19 October 2011 the Vilnius City Third District Court approved an application by V.\u0160. to be released on probation. The court held that at that time V.\u0160. was serving his sentence in Vilnius Correctional Facility, where he had taken part in the social rehabilitation, legal and social education programmes and had provided information that he would be employed on release.",
                "24.  By a judgment of 18 July 2012 the K\u0117dainiai District Court found the applicant guilty of bribing an intermediary and sentenced him to sixty days in prison. The court found it established that G.T. had given the applicant LTL 2,000 and LTL 30,000 respectively during their meetings on 2 February and 29 March 2011 in return for a promise that the applicant would help in the proceedings for V.\u0160.\u2019s release on probation. The applicant pleaded not guilty and stated that an act of provocation had been organised against him. He also stated that the money he had received was remuneration for his services as V.\u0160.\u2019s lawyer. The applicant said that although no agreement on the provision of legal assistance had been concluded, he had intended to conclude one after the proceedings for V.\u0160.\u2019s release on probation. The applicant refused to provide comments on the recordings and stated that his conversations with V.\u0160. were irrelevant because he had only wanted to show that he was working on his case. Those conversations had not been of any consequence as he had not been able to influence L.D. or the judges at Kai\u0161iadorys District Court and Kaunas Regional Court (Pokalbi\u0173 telefonu ir \u012fra\u0161u su V.[\u0160.] nekomentuoja, paai\u0161kindamas, kad visi jo pokalbiai su V.[\u0160.] buvo d\u0117l aki\u0173, kadangi ka\u017ek\u0105 kalb\u0117ti su V.[\u0160.] reik\u0117jo, tad nieko nerei\u0161kian\u010diais pokalbiais jis tik siek\u0117 parodyti, kad dirba, ta\u010diau tuo jis nesiek\u0117 sukelti joki\u0173 pasekmi\u0173, kadangi negal\u0117jo paveikti nei L.[D.], nei Kai\u0161iadori\u0173 apylink\u0117s ar Kauno apygardos teismo teis\u0117j\u0173). G.T. stated that he had known V.\u0160. since 2000 and that V.\u0160. had called him and asked for help. When G.T. had gone to Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Correctional Facility, V.\u0160. had told him that the applicant required money and that V.\u0160. doubted that the money would be used in the proper way.\nThe court\u2019s conclusions were based on the evidence given by V.\u0160., G.T., L.D. and other employees of Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Correctional Facility. It also addressed the secret recordings of the applicant\u2019s conversations, including those recorded prior to the authorisation for actions imitating criminal conduct. The court held that the transcripts of the conversations between the applicant and V.\u0160. showed that the applicant had been the first to indicate the amounts of money to be paid. The applicant\u2019s statement that he had been going to conclude an agreement on legal services after he had taken LTL 30,000 were refuted by his conversation with G.T., where the applicant had stated that in case of failure he would keep 20% of the money and return the rest. The video-recordings showed that the applicant had not counted the money and that he had indicated to G.T. to put it in the side pocket of the car door. That allowed the court to draw the conclusion that the applicant realised that the money was remuneration for his criminal activity. The court further held that V.\u0160.\u2019s testimony, voice and video\u2011recordings showed that the applicant had not been incited to take a bribe and that the criminal conduct simulation model had been applied within the limits prescribed by the court (see paragraph 12 above). By the same judgment the K\u0117dainiai District Court found L.D. guilty of abuse of office and forgery, which had allowed V.\u0160. to be transferred to a unit with lighter security (see paragraph 10 above). It ordered L.D. to pay a fine of LTL 12,480 (approximately EUR 3,614). L.D. pleaded guilty, but stated that V.\u0160. had named the applicant as a lawyer that could help him obtain release on probation. The court decided to return the recorder watch to V.\u0160.",
                "25.  The applicant and L.D. lodged an appeal. The applicant argued that the provisions of domestic law had been applied incorrectly, that V.\u0160. and G.T. used undue pressure, and that V.\u0160. had used unauthorised equipment, the recorder watch, which he had not been allowed to have in prison. The applicant asked the appellate court to question V.\u0160. and ask him how he had acquired such a watch in a correctional facility. The applicant also stated that L.D. had overseen matters relating to V.\u0160.\u2019s transfer to a unit with lighter security and that there was no evidence that he had tried to bribe L.D. The applicant also stated that he had never named any specific person in the courts whom he would have bribed because he had not intended to perform such an act. He had only talked to V.\u0160. about the outcome of the proceedings for release on probation because V.\u0160. had called him constantly.",
                "26.  On 23 October 2012 the Court of Appeal approved an application by the prosecutor to transfer the case to Panev\u0117\u017eys Regional Court from Kaunas Regional Court for examination on appeal in order to have a fair trial.",
                "27.  The Panev\u0117\u017eys Regional Court held an oral hearing where several witnesses, including V.\u0160., had been questioned. On 13 June 2013 the Panev\u0117\u017eys Regional Court held that V.\u0160. had purchased the watch for his personal use and that the provisions of domestic law did not directly prohibit the use of such equipment in prison. The court also held that the initial contact between V.\u0160. and the applicant had been arranged by L.D., that V.\u0160. had not known the applicant beforehand and had not had any motive to incite him to commit a crime. The court also found that no agreement on the provision of legal services had been concluded between the applicant and V.\u0160. and that the applicant\u2019s argument that he had intended to conclude one later had been dismissed as an attempt to improve his situation. On the basis of the audio-recordings, the court also observed that the applicant had been the first to say that he could settle the matter for money. The court also found that there had been no incitement and that the authorities had not put any active pressure on the applicant to commit an offence. On the contrary, the applicant had incited V.\u0160. to give him an amount that would be sufficient for himself, an intermediary and three court judges. The court also held that at the time the offence had been committed, Article 226 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code provided for two alternative sentences for bribery of an intermediary: arrest or imprisonment for up to three years. On 5 July 2011 the Criminal Code had been amended and the applicant\u2019s offence had then satisfied the requirements of Article 226 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code, which provided for various sentences: a fine, arrest or imprisonment for up to five years. As the provision in force provided for a more lenient sentence, the court decided to impose a fine of LTL 65,000 (approximately EUR 18,825). The court dismissed L.D.\u2019s appeal by the same judgment.",
                "28.  The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law. He again argued that he had been incited to commit an offence, that V.\u0160., as a convicted prisoner, was not allowed to have recording equipment, that he had been provided with that equipment by the STT, and that the transcripts of the recordings should not have been used as evidence against him in the case. The applicant also alleged that the LTL 2,000 had been remuneration for his legal services and that he had not actually taken the LTL 30,000 from G.T., who had simply left the money in his car. The applicant further complained that the court of first instance had not even assessed whether the evidence had been lawfully collected. The appellate court, in turn, had approved evidence that had been gathered unlawfully and had misinterpreted domestic law. The applicant also argued that V.\u0160.\u2019s testimony had contradicted itself: it was not clear who had informed the STT about the alleged crime.",
                "29.  On 28 January 2014 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law. The court held that the pre-trial investigation had been opened on 28 January 2011 upon the request of V.\u0160. Together with his testimony, V.\u0160. had given the authorities his voice-recording watch, where he had recorded his conversations with L.D. and the applicant. The court held that convicted prisoners who used voice recorders breached internal prison regulations, but that did not mean that officers who carried out a pre\u2011trial investigation and obtained information from such a voice recorder acted unlawfully. The court also held that the finding of the applicant\u2019s guilt had not been based solely on the evidence obtained from V.\u0160.\u2019s watch. The court observed that L.D. had suggested the applicant as a lawyer because he knew the prosecutors and judges dealing with V.\u0160.\u2019s case, while L.D. had not incited the applicant to take bribes. By the same judgment the Supreme Court left an appeal on points of law by L.D. unexamined because therein he had raised arguments that had not been raised before the appellate court.",
                "30.  On 19 December 2014 the Supreme Court examined an application by the applicant to reopen the proceedings. It decided not to do so, but reduced the fine to LTL 13,000 (approximately EUR 3,765)."

After being transported back to Budapest Prison, the applicant underwent a medical examination before his readmission during which he claimed that he had been ill-treated by police officer A. Certain injuries were noted on the applicant. A report was drawn up on the incident and photos were taken of the injuries.",
                "9.  Right after the medical examination the applicant was again transported to the Budapest Main Police Department for questioning, from where he was taken to the military hospital by the police officer conducting his interrogation and allegedly assaulting him. At the hospital he was examined in the presence of the police officer. The medical report noted bleeding on the lower lip, jaw sensitive to pressure, and bruises on the ribs, all likely to heal within eight days.",

None of the police officers had seen the applicant harming himself but A. had observed him biting his nails and lips. Also, according to the report, the applicant had been left alone for a few minutes at the police station without constant surveillance.",
                "12.  On 20 July 2012 the applicant complained of a headache and dizziness and was again examined by medical staff at Budapest Prison. He asserted that he had been ill-treated during his interrogation. The medical report recorded the following injuries: swelling on the right cheek, head sensitive to pressure, bruising on the lower lip, and abrasions on the lower right ribs and on the left shoulder blade.",

In the ensuing criminal investigation conducted by the Central Investigation Office the applicant gave a testimony on 14 November 2012, stating that during his questioning he had refused to make a statement and as a consequence had been punched by one of the police officers several times on his head, neck and back. He had fallen against a chair and when he had tried to get up, he had been slapped four or five times in the face. He had been shown the results of a DNA test, and when he refused to comment on it, had again been beaten by the police officer. The same police officer had also punched him in the mouth when he had failed to recognise a person shown to him in a photograph. He had been pushed against the door and when he again fell over, the police officer had kicked him on his left side.",

He also stated that he had noted the injuries on the applicant\u2019s face following the medical examination at Budapest Prison. He had asked the applicant why he had not complained of his ill-treatment earlier, to which the applicant had replied that he had been afraid of the police officers. According to C, as a general practice, detainees had been transferred in a special prisoner transport vehicle where they had not been constantly monitored and would have had the opportunity to inflict injuries on themselves.",

He did not remember either the applicant or the circumstances of his transfer. He had a vague recollection that since there had been some complaints from the applicant\u2019s side once they had arrived back at the prison facility, they had had to transfer him back to the police department. He maintained that if they had seen any injury on the applicant\u2019s face following interrogation, they would surely have inquired of him whether he had been ill-treated by the police officers. Therefore, in his estimation the applicant could not have shown any visible signs of injury when he was handed back from the interrogation.",

He could not remember whether he had escorted the applicant to the medical examination, but suggested that the applicant\u2019s injuries must have occurred before he had been examined by the medical staff, which was why he had been called on to take photos.",
                "18.  On 18 November 2013 F, the nurse on duty at Budapest Prison was questioned, but she did not remember the incident. She could only confirm that if she had seen the applicant\u2019s injuries prior to his transfer, she would surely have inquired about their origin. Examining the photos of the applicant, she asserted that the bruises on the applicant\u2019s face would have occurred immediately after an impact and that the applicant could have caused them himself.",
                "19.  On 5 December 2013 G, the guard on duty at Budapest Prison, was questioned as a witness; he could not remember either the applicant or anything else concerning his complaint. He nonetheless maintained that if he had seen injuries on the applicant as presented to him on a photo, he would surely have inquired about their origin.",
                "20.  On 2 January 2014 the Central Investigation Office also heard evidence from H and I, two prison escort officers from Budapest Prison who had been on duty on the day of the incident, and who were responsible for transferring detainees to the healthcare facilities. They did not remember the applicant and could not recall the circumstances of his medical examination or admission to the prison, since, as one of them explained, they were responsible for escorting thirty to forty prisoners a day. H stated that as a general practice detainees were under constant supervision while waiting for medical examinations, whereas I asserted that there were instances where detainees were left alone when placed in so\u2011called \u201chealthcare waiting rooms\u201d. Neither of the witnesses knew with certainty whether this had been the case for the applicant.",
                "21.  On the same day, three members of the medical staff of Budapest Prison were also heard as witnesses. Two of them could not recall anything about the incident and did not remember the applicant, mostly because they were responsible for a large number of cases. Another member of the healthcare staff stated that she had a recollection of an incident, but was not sure whether it involved the applicant or another person. As a general rule, the witnesses explained that they would not admit a detainee into the prison if he showed signs of injuries. Examining the photos of the applicant, two of the medical staff stated that because of the bad quality of the photos, they weren\u2019t even sure if they showed actual injuries or simply the shape of the applicant\u2019s face, while the third asserted that the injury must have been fresh when the photo was taken.",
                "22.  The prison doctor was also questioned the same day. She could not identify the applicant, did not remember whether she had met him, had no recollection of the incident and could only recount what she had previously stated in the medical report. However, she stated that if the applicant had been left alone, he could have inflicted the injuries on himself.",
                "23.  The Central Investigation Office commissioned a forensic expert opinion. According to the expert assessment, the applicant\u2019s account of the origins of his injuries was implausible, since if he had been ill-treated in the way described by him, his injuries would have been of a more serious nature. Furthermore, the location of the injuries had not corresponded to the applicant\u2019s description of the incident either. The report stated that it was impossible to establish when the applicant\u2019s injuries had occurred. Referring to the witness testimonies and the location of the injuries, it suggested that the applicant could have inflicted them on himself.",
                "24.  The investigation was discontinued on 8 May 2014 on the grounds that the applicant\u2019s allegations could not be substantiated beyond doubt in the absence of any witness testimony and taking into account the conclusions of the forensic expert opinion. According to the reasoning, the available evidence neither refuted nor proved the applicant\u2019s allegations. The applicant complained, seeking the continuation of the investigations. The first-instance decision was upheld by the Chief Prosecutor\u2019s Office on 15 July 2014. The decision called the applicant\u2019s attention to the possibility of lodging of initiating substitute private prosecution proceedings."
