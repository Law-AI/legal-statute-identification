                "5.  The applicants were born in 1981 and 1966 respectively and live in Ecemi\u015f village near the town of Lice, located with the administrative jurisdiction of the province of Diyarbak\u0131r.",
                "6.  The facts of the case as submitted by the parties, and as they appear from the documents submitted by them, may be summarised as follows.",
                "7.  At the time of the events the first applicant\u2019s brother and the second applicant\u2019s nephew Murat Tekdal was thirty years old and lived in Ecemi\u015f village.",
                "8.  On 12 September 2008 Murat Tekdal returned to his village of Ecemi\u015f after having visited his uncle, the second applicant. Later the same day he left his home to walk to the nearby \u015eenlik village.",
                "16.  During the autopsy the doctor observed two bullet holes on Murat Tekdal\u2019s lower left abdomen. He also noted that bullets had skimmed both hands and the lower right side of the abdomen and caused superficial injuries. There was also a superficial injury on the front of the right axilla. The internal examination of the body revealed injuries to the stomach, liver, diaphragm, spleen, intestines and lungs, all caused by bullets. A bullet measuring approximately 0.7 centimetres was found inside the body. Samples taken from the body were sent for further forensic analyses. An x\u2011ray of the body showed a large number of metallic objects inside the abdomen. The doctor concluded that death had been caused by bullets which had either entered or exited from the lower left abdomen. He also recommended that the clothes with bullet holes in them be sent to the forensic authorities with a view to determining the distance and the direction from which he had been shot.",
                "19.  On 22 October 2008 the Diyarbak\u0131r prosecutor decided not to bring any criminal proceedings against Murat Tekdal for the above-mentioned offence, because he was dead.",
                "22.  The applicants\u2019 objection was rejected by the Malatya Assize Court on 9 April 2010. The Assize Court stated that the prosecutor\u2019s decision had concerned an offence which the applicants\u2019 deceased relative was suspected of having committed. The objection lodged by the applicants, on the other hand, concerned the killing of their relative. The Assize Court stated that there was no on-going investigation into the killing of Murat Tekdal and that there had not been a decision not to prosecute anyone in respect of his killing. As there was no on-going investigation into the killing, the applicants had no standing to bring an objection against the Diyarbak\u0131r prosecutor\u2019s decision. The Assize Court\u2019s decision was communicated to the applicants on 30 April 2010."

                "6.  On 20 July 2015 a quarrel broke out between the applicant and his common-law wife, H.M. The latter called an ambulance because the applicant was under the influence of alcohol and was behaving oddly, and had a violent outburst.",
                "19.  On 17 December 2015 the Central Investigation Office discontinued the criminal proceedings for lack of any conclusive evidence (as regards ill\u2011treatment committed in the course of official proceedings and assault causing actual bodily harm) and for the absence of a crime (as regards causing grievous bodily harm). According to the Investigation Office, it could not be established which injuries occurred during the police measures and whether they were caused by ill-treatment or the applicant\u2019s own behaviour. The decision also stated that the applicant\u2019s tibia could not have been broken during the incident and that the applicant\u2019s credibility was questionable due to his drunkenness.",
                "20.  The applicant filed a complaint against the discontinuation order. He maintained that his colleagues and supervisors, as well as the members of his household could have confirmed that he had no leg injury before the incident if they were heard as witnesses or if specific questions were put to them in this regard. He also submitted that Dr CS.H. (see paragraph 9 above) had been biased and questioned the credibility of the statement in the expert opinion of 1 November 2015 concerning his drunkenness (see paragraph 18 in fine above).",
                "21.  On 18 February 2016 the chief prosecutor\u2019s office dismissed the complaint. It endorsed the first-instance decision concerning the assessment of evidence and the legal classification thereof, informing the applicant of the possibility of pursuing substitute private prosecution proceedings."

                "6.  On 2 April 2013, between 1 and 1.15 p.m., the applicant was stopped by two officers of the Benevento municipal police while she was driving her car.",
                "7.  According to the applicant, the police officers checked her driver\u2019s licence and her vehicle documents. An argument broke out between the applicant and the officers. In the applicant\u2019s view, her nervous and hostile attitude led the police officers to suspect that she was intoxicated, which she denied. As the officers did not have the necessary equipment to perform a breathalyser test, they requested the assistance of the road police (Polizia Stradale). The applicant returned to her car. Once she had got back into the vehicle, one of the police officers pulled the car door open and dragged her out by the arm.",
                "8.  As recorded in the municipal police officers\u2019 report of 3 April 2013, the applicant had been stopped because she had been driving in an erratic manner, braking suddenly and changing lanes abruptly. The applicant did not seem to be able to exit the vehicle by herself and had had to be assisted by one of the officers. The officers reported that they had smelt alcohol on her breath and that she had been unsteady on her feet. The applicant had insulted and threatened them.",
                "9.  At 1.30 p.m. traffic police officers arrived on the scene with the breathalyser equipment.",
                "10.  According to the applicant, she was not able to take the test because she was in a state of anxiety that had been exacerbated by one of the officers shouting at her that she was drunk. That had caused her to tremble and had meant she could not keep the breathalyser tube in her mouth. The applicant requested that carabinieri be called to the scene, but the request was denied.",
                "11.  According to the traffic police report (annotazione di servizio della Polizia Stradale), the applicant agreed to be breathalysed, but did not blow into the device in the manner she had been told to do by the officers and refused to cooperate. At one point she had thrown the device\u2019s mouthpiece into the face of one of the officers. The applicant was described as being in a \u201cclearly altered\u201d state, smelling strongly of alcohol and staggering.",
                "12.  The applicant was taken to the municipal police station (Comando di Polizia Municipale), where she arrived at approximately 1.50 p.m.",
                "13.  According to the applicant, once at the station the lieutenant on duty started drafting an offence report (verbale di contestazione) for driving under the influence of alcohol. The two officers who had stopped her in the street and escorted her to the station and another officer were also present. She repeatedly requested that she be allowed to use a telephone to let her family and her lawyer know of her whereabouts but her requests were denied. When she tried to pick up a telephone, one of the officers hit her in order to make her sit down. The same officer twisted her arms behind her back and handcuffed her, hurting her wrists. He then squeezed her buttocks and asked her if the handcuffs were tight enough. The applicant started screaming loudly and the officer removed the handcuffs in a violent manner. In doing so, he fractured the applicant\u2019s right thumb and caused other injuries to her wrists. He then warned her not to cause further trouble and threatened her. The applicant left the station between 2.15 and 2.30 p.m. and proceeded further on foot as her car had been seized.",
                "15.  According to the applicant, once she had left the station she got a lift to the emergency department of a local hospital, where she was examined.",
                "17.  On 4 April 2013 the applicant lodged a criminal complaint against the two police officers who had stopped her in the street on 2 April 2013 and the other two officers who had been present at the municipal police station, but whose names she did not know, alleging assault and battery, infliction of bodily harm, abuse of office, and threats.",
                "19.  On 17 January 2014 the public prosecutor requested that the proceedings be discontinued. The basis of the request was that \u201cthe allegations in the criminal complaint are not confirmed by the statements made by the witnesses identified by the victim\u201d.",
                "21.  At a hearing on 22 September 2014 the applicant\u2019s lawyer repeated the complaints and requests contained in the objection against the prosecutor\u2019s request to discontinue the proceedings and reiterated, in particular, the request to conduct an investigation into the events that had occurred at the municipal police station.",
                "22.  By an order of 3 October 2014, served on the applicant on 27 October 2014, the Benevento District Court preliminary investigations judge (giudice per le indagini preliminari) decided to discontinue the proceedings. The order stated that the evidence gathered during the preliminary investigation had not been sufficient to warrant indicting the officers. It stated that the victim\u2019s allegations had not been corroborated by evidence and that further investigative measures, as requested by the victim, would have \u201cno influence whatsoever\u201d.",
                "23.  On 25 October 2013 the applicant was charged with a number of offences in connection with the events of 2 April 2013, including resisting a police officer, insulting a public official, and driving under the influence of alcohol. The applicant was also charged with causing bodily harm to a police officer.",
                "24.  On an unspecified date, the public prosecutor and the applicant reached a plea agreement with respect to the offence of bodily harm and requested that the judge proceed with the imposition of a sentence (applicazione della pena su richiesta delle parti).",
                "25.  On 21 November 2014 the Benevento preliminary hearings judge took note of the plea agreement and gave the applicant a suspended sentence of twenty-eight days\u2019 imprisonment. On the same day, the preliminary hearings judge suspended the proceedings against the applicant in connection with the charges of resisting a police officer, insulting a public official and driving under the influence of alcohol. The applicant was placed on probation with a requirement that she perform community service.",
                "29.  Owing to a traumatic event in her life, the applicant suffers from chronic post-traumatic stress disorder, which has evolved into a major depressive disorder. She also suffers from a disorder which is characterised by mood swings which are exacerbated in times of particular stress, by the consumption of alcohol or sleep deprivation. The disorder in question includes peaks of manic behaviour when the applicant loses contact with reality and experiences a sense of impending threat to her own safety and that of those around her. The applicant was prescribed drugs for insomnia in February 2013. Combining the drugs with even moderate amounts of alcohol can have the same consequences as excessive alcohol consumption."

                "8.  On 12 August 2013 he lodged an application with the Court complaining that he was not receiving adequate medical assistance in detention. Four days later the Court indicated to the Russian Government under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court that he should be examined by medical experts.",
                "9.  On 27 November 2014 the Court delivered a judgment in the case, finding, inter alia, that there had been violations of Articles 3 and 34 of the Convention on account of the authorities\u2019 failure to provide the applicant with adequate medical care or to comply with the interim measure indicated (see Amirov v. Russia, no. 51857/13, \u00a7\u00a7 75, 93, and 94, 27 November 2014).",
                "10.  Relying on Article 46 of the Convention the Court held that the authorities should admit the applicant, at that time detained in remand prison no. 4 in Rostov-on-Don, to a specialised medical facility where he should remain under constant medical supervision and should be provided with adequate medical services corresponding to his needs; alternatively, the authorities could place him in a specialised prison medical facility, if the facility could guarantee the requisite level of medical supervision and care. (see Amirov, cited above, \u00a7 118).",
                "11.   After 27 November 2014, the date of the Court\u2019s judgment in the applicant\u2019s first case, he continued being detained in the remand prison pending the completion of his trial.",
                "14.  The applicant\u2019s lawyers noticed, however, that his state of health had worsened. They solicited medical opinions on the treatment required.",
                "18.  In the meantime, on 27 August 2015 the Military Court of the North\u2011Caucasus Circuit found the applicant guilty of having organised an act of terrorism and an attempt to murder an investigator in his case. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in a high-security correctional colony. The Supreme Court of Russia upheld the conviction and sentence on 24 March 2016.",
                "19.  On 1 April 2016 the applicant was sent to serve his sentence in the correctional colony.",
                "20.   He spent the first two weeks of his detention in an ordinary cell in the quarantine wing. According to a letter from the chairman of the Committee for Civil Rights sent to the applicant\u2019s lawyer on 20 April 2016, the cell was not adapted to the needs of a wheelchair prisoner. The applicant depended on his fellow inmates, who assisted him in his daily needs, including helping him to perform enemas on himself.",
                "21.  Every day the applicant was taken, handcuffed and blindfolded, to the prison yard for exercise.",
                "24.  On 14 April 2016 the applicant was moved to medical unit no. 56 and placed in cell no. 12. He shared its space of 14 sq. m with one cellmate. The applicant was provided with a wide bed, a sink installed at a low level, and a medical couch, which he used during self-catheterisation procedures. Enemas were carried out in a separate room twice a week with the assistance of the medical unit staff. The custodial authorities continued handcuffing and blindfolding him while he was escorted to the yard.",
                "28.  From 6 to 8 June 2016 a commission of officials from the Russian Ombudsman\u2019s Office, the Orenburg Ombudsman\u2019s Office, the Orenburg prosecutor\u2019s office, the Federal Service of the Execution for Sentences in Orenburg Region and medical unit no. 56 came to the applicant\u2019s detention facility and examined the quality of his medical care. The commission concluded that it was adequate.",
                "29.  On 8 June 2016 the applicant was visited by an exercise-therapy specialist, who taught him exercises to support his health. It appears that this visit was a follow-up to previous visits by the specialist, in April and May 2016. However, the medical record does not disclose particular details of the recommendations made on those two previous occasions.",
                "30.  On 4 July 2016 two members of the Orenburg Regional Public Commission for Monitoring the Protection of Human Rights in Detention (\u041e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043d\u0430\u0431\u043b\u044e\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f \u041e\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438) inspected the colony. It appears that by the time of the inspection the applicant had been moved to another cell. The inspectors noted in particular, that the cell was divided into three sections by metal bars and housed six inmates. The applicant\u2019s section measured 10.8 sq. m; it had a bath, a medical couch, a sink, and a bedside table with television set. The toilet was not partitioned from the rest of the cell and the applicant could be observed by his cellmate while using it. The correctional colony lacked wheelchair ramps, so the applicant could not freely access the yard or meeting rooms. He complained that the necessary drugs had had to be supplied by his relatives, owing to a lack of funds, which were to be allocated in the near future. Medical supervision was carried out by the general practitioner as regular examinations by other specialists had not been considered necessary. Allegedly owing to the applicant not having received medical massages, the applicant\u2019s legs started convulsing. He was assisted by his cellmate, who helped him to get into bed. The applicant was not given a special diet.",
                "31.  On 11 August 25 October and 16 December 2016, and 19 April 2017 a special medical board of highly qualified civilian and prison doctors, and specialists in cardiology, endocrinology, neurology, and urology examined the applicant. They concluded that there was no need to admit the applicant to a specialist medical facility and that he could continue receiving treatment in the medical unit. The doctors were satisfied with the quality of medical care given to the applicant."

The report also stated that the victims had no right to withdraw their consent to the settlement procedure.

At the hearing, the prosecutor firstly noted that the applicants had not submitted any documents concerning their claim for legal costs, despite the fact that they had had a week after the settlement to do so. According to the report of the hearing, the prosecutor later noted that those documents could have been submitted when the applicants had signed the report (see paragraph 10 above) or a few days later. The report stated that J. had wanted to submit the out-of-court settlement agreement to the judge in order to prove that it covered all the relevant damages. However, the Court of Appeal had refused, considering that it did not concern the subject matter of the dispute before the court in those proceedings.",
                "20.  By a decision of 13 April 2011, the Tallinn Court of Appeal dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal and upheld the Harju County Court\u2019s decision of 23 March 2011. It referred to Article 243 of the CCrP, under which the victim was not entitled to revoke his or her consent to the application of the settlement procedure, and to Article 246 of the Code, which provided that the victim did not have to be summoned to a court hearing in settlement proceedings (see paragraphs 28 and 29 below). The Court of Appeal concluded that the applicants, as victims, had not been parties to such court proceedings and that, accordingly, they had no right to appeal against the County Court\u2019s judgment.",
                "21.  Although the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision stated that it was final and not amenable to appeal, the applicants\u2019 counsel nevertheless challenged it before the Supreme Court.",
                "22.  By a decision of 3 October 2011 in case no. 3-1-1-60-11 the Supreme Court refused to examine the appeal on points of law because the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision had been final and not amenable to appeal. It nevertheless stated that according to the established case-law, in settlement proceedings the court should not limit itself to merely analysing the settlement reached. It must also verify whether there were still questions that should be addressed in the subsequent judgment, but which had not been included in the settlement agreement. The court noted that according to Article 245 of the CCrP, the settlement agreement did not necessarily have to address matters dealing with the costs of criminal procedure or cover the extent of granting the civil claim or of compensating for the damage caused by the criminal offence. However, referring to Article 306 \u00a7\u00a7 11, 13 and 14 of the CCrP and Article 248 \u00a7 1 (3) of the CCrP, the Supreme Court considered that those matters should not be overlooked by the court concerned (see paragraphs 30 and 31 below)."

Therefore a total of 227 police officers were deployed, including two squads \u2013 comprising eight to ten police officers each \u2013 of the 3rd platoon of the Munich riot control unit (Unterst\u00fctzungskommando), one squad of the 2nd platoon of the Munich riot control unit and the 23rd platoon of the 6th Dachau public-order support force battalion (Bereitschaftspolizei). The deployed officers of the Munich riot control unit also included \u201cvideo officers\u201d, who carried handheld video cameras and recorded videos of incidents that might be relevant under criminal law. The officers of the Munich riot control unit were dressed in black/dark blue uniforms and wore black helmets with visors. The officers of the Dachau public-order support force battalion wore green uniforms and white helmets with visors. Both uniforms did not include any name tags or other signs identifying the individual officers. However, on the back of the helmets an identification number of the squad was displayed.",

When the supporters streamed from the stands towards the exit, they came upon police units which had been called in to provide backup for the police cordon. Subsequently some of the supporters continued their aggressive behaviour towards these officers and provoked them. The supporters\u2019 conduct resulted in the arrest of one supporter and two police officers sustained minor injuries. After a few minutes the police pacified the situation and got the exiting supporters under control.",

The DVDs were compiled by the \u201cvideo officers\u201d of the Munich riot control unit. In line with their usual procedure the entire recorded video material was reviewed by the respective video officer after his or her deployment and the parts which were deemed relevant under criminal law and of sufficient quality to serve as evidence were copied to a DVD.",

On 20 October 2008 the head of the investigation unit met with the platoon leaders of the Munich riot control unit and other division heads of the Munich police to discuss the investigation. Neither the public prosecutor nor the applicants\u2019 representative attended the internal police meeting. Subsequently, a further twenty-two witnesses were interviewed including fourteen platoon leaders, squad leaders and video officers of the deployed police units. The individual squad members of the three squads of the Munich riot control unit were not interviewed. The applicants had requested that they be interviewed, as the evidence had suggested that the alleged perpetrators had belonged to one of these three squads.",

After assessing all the available evidence, the public prosecutor concluded that the enquiries had shown that several supporters had aggressively approached, insulted and provoked the deployed police officers and that therefore a situation had existed in which the officers could have been justified in using their truncheons. Besides this general conclusion he held that the applicants had neither been able to identify a particular suspect nor to determine whether the suspected police officers had been male or female and that the investigation had not produced other persons who had witnessed the alleged acts against the applicants. Furthermore, he outlined in detail certain \u201cconsiderable discrepancies\u201d in the witness statements of the first applicant and referred to \u201cunspecific\u201d statements of the second applicant. Consequently, according to the public prosecutor, there was insufficient evidence to establish criminal conduct by specific police officers to the detriment of both applicants. He concluded that the investigation had to be discontinued again, since the considerable additional investigative measures had not revealed disproportionate conduct on the part of individual police officers, in particular truncheon strikes against innocent bystanders, which would require criminal prosecution of the respective officers.",
                "22.  On 20 August 2009 the applicants appealed and pointed out that the members of the deployed squads had still not been questioned and that the inspected videos were fragmentary, but nonetheless contradicted certain parts of the statements made by the squad leaders.",
                "23.  On 3 February 2011 the Munich general public prosecutor confirmed the decision of the public prosecutor\u2019s office of 4 August 2009 to discontinue the investigation. The instructions on available legal remedies attached to the decision informed the applicants that they could request a judicial decision in the framework of proceedings to force criminal proceedings (Klageerzwingungsverfahren).",
                "24.  On 19 September 2011 the Munich Court of Appeal declared the applicants\u2019 application to force further enquiries inadmissible. The court interpreted the applicants\u2019 request as an application to force criminal proceedings (Klageerzwingungsantrag) and held that these proceedings were only admissible if the prosecution of one or more identified accused had been requested. An application to force criminal proceedings against an unidentified accused had to be declared inadmissible, since the proceedings were not supposed to identify the accused or replace investigations. Only in a case where a public prosecutor\u2019s office had entirely refrained from investigating a crime had a court the possibility to order an investigation. Under Article 173 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Strafprozessordnung \u2013 hereinafter \u201cthe CCP\u201d; see paragraph 37 below) a court was only allowed to conduct minor enquiries to fill in remaining gaps in an investigation. Moreover, the applicants had not submitted specific facts or evidence that would have allowed the court to identify an accused.",
                "25.  On 25 October 2011 the applicants lodged a constitutional complaint, relying on Articles 2 \u00a7 2, 19 \u00a7 4 and 103 \u00a7 1 of the German Basic Law (Grundgesetz) (see paragraphs 29-31 below). Besides referring to articles of the Basic Law, the applicants also referred in their complaint to Articles 2, 3, and 13 of the Convention. In essence they complained that the investigation had not been effective and that the Court of Appeal had not evaluated the effectiveness of the investigation.",
                "26.  On 23 March 2015 the Federal Constitutional Court (hereinafter \u201cthe Constitutional Court\u201d) refused, in a reasoned decision (2 BvR 1304/12), to admit the applicants\u2019 constitutional complaint. The court held that the investigations had been conducted diligently, but had not established sufficient suspicion of criminal conduct on the part of specific police officers. Moreover, the remaining gaps and factual uncertainties could not be attributed to omissions in the investigation. The court also found that it had not been necessary to question all the squad members who had possibly been involved. In its decision the Constitutional Court referred to the Court\u2019s case-law concerning the procedural obligation of Article 2 of the Convention and, in particular, to the cases of McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom (27 September 1995, Series A no. 324) and Grams v. Germany ((dec.), no. 33677/96, ECHR 1999\u2011VII). The court also emphasised that the public prosecutor\u2019s office had been the responsible authority for the investigation and thereby \u201cmaster of the proceedings\u201d (Herr des Verfahrens).",
                "27.  During the investigation the applicants also filed criminal complaints in respect of assistance given in an official capacity in avoiding prosecution or punishment (Strafvereitelung im Amt) and suppression of evidence (Beweismittelunterdr\u00fcckung). The applicants alleged that several relevant parts of the video material, showing disproportionate police violence, had been deleted. The investigation against the five police officers was discontinued by the Munich public prosecutor\u2019s office.",
                "28.  A subsequent appeal before the Munich general public prosecutor was to no avail."

On 24 November 2005 a residential building maintenance services provider, Kurzemes Namu Apsaimniekot\u0101js, a limited liability company (\u201cthe plaintiff\u201d), brought a claim against the applicant for recovery of a debt for their services in the amount of 320 Latvian lati (LVL \u2013 approximately 455 euros (EUR)). The next day civil proceedings were instituted in that connection. The applicant disagreed; she argued that she did not owe any money to the plaintiff \u2013 they had not concluded an agreement for maintenance services and she was free to choose another service provider. In those proceedings the applicant was represented by Mr S. Se\u013cez\u0146ovs, who was not a lawyer.",

The City Court imposed a monetary fine on the applicant\u2019s representative for disobeying a judge\u2019s order. Following an application by the plaintiff the hearing was postponed because the applicant\u2019s debt for services had in the meantime increased; they had not prepared the documents for the increased amount of the debt.

On 6 November 2008 the City Court dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the applicant as unsubstantiated \u2013 the plaintiff had not proved that the expenses had actually been incurred and that they had duly reflected the services provided. On 27 November 2008 the plaintiff appealed against the judgment. On 28 November 2008 a judge of the City Court gave the plaintiff additional time to comply with the procedural requirements for lodging an appeal. On 2 December 2008 the plaintiff rectified those deficiencies.

                "7.  During an expert examination of the remains of the building on 26 August 1999, certain problems were noted with the building\u2019s reinforcing rods. It was also noted that the metal brackets had not been properly fastened to the girders. Apart from H.E. and S.D., against whom charges had already been brought in connection with the collapse of the building, the experts also identified the involvement of T.A., a civil engineer, and \u0130.\u00d6., the Head of Technical Services of the Municipality of D\u00fczce (\u201cthe Municipality\u201d), in the preparation and authorisation of the respective construction project.",
                "8.  On 31 August 1999 the police questioned \u0130.\u00d6., the Head of Technical Services of the Municipality. He denied all accusations in respect of the collapse of the building.",
                "9.  According to another report dated 7 September 1999, the expert examination of the collapsed building revealed that the granulometry of the concrete used in the building was very poor, that the concrete contained a very high proportion of pebbles, that the water-to-cement ratio in the concrete mix was not appropriate and had resulted in the formation of pores in the concrete, and that the ironwork had worked loose from the concrete because the metal brackets had corroded.",
                "11.  On 23 September 1999 the D\u00fczce public prosecutor disjoined the investigation against the Head of Technical Services of the Municipality (\u0130.\u00d6.) from those against H.E. and S.D. in view of the special judicial procedures that had to be followed in respect of the prosecution of civil servants under the Law on the Prosecution of Civil Servants and Public Officials (Law no. 4483).",
                "14.  According to an expert report added to the criminal case file on 29 April 2001, the following people had responsibility for all private construction undertaken within the municipal boundaries: (i) the contractor, who was responsible for the realisation of the project in compliance with the technical and work safety standards; (ii) the project engineer, who was responsible for all technical aspects of the project, including compliance with all relevant rules and regulations; (iii) the municipal representative, who was responsible for examining the calculations and the plan prepared by the project manager, verifying the compatibility of the project with the regulations in force, and authorising the project; and (iv) the technical implementation officer, who was in charge of inspecting the construction work on behalf of the Municipality. On this basis, the experts concluded that H.E. and S.D. bore 25% and 37.5% responsibility for the collapse of the building. The experts stated that they could not, however, offer opinions on the responsibility of anyone other than the two defendants in the case (H.E. and S.D.).",
                "16.  On 21 October 2002 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the first-instance court. It held that the statutory time-limit was to be calculated from the date on which the building collapsed, that is to say from 17 August 1999, the date on which the offence in question had been committed.",
                "18.  On 11 December 2003 the D\u00fczce Assize Court convicted H.E., S.D. and T.A. as charged and sentenced each of them to 10 months\u2019 imprisonment and a fine, but decided to suspend execution of the sentences under Section 6 of the Execution of Sentences Act (Law no. 647). The applicant appealed against this judgment and once again requested an investigation into the responsibility of the relevant municipal officials in relation to the collapse of the building.",
                "19.  On 6 July 2004 the Court of Cassation once again quashed the first\u2011instance court\u2019s judgment, this time as the court had not taken any decision as regards the applicant\u2019s request to join the proceedings as a civil party in respect of the case subsequently brought against T.A.",

The expert report subsequently released on 21 April 2005 found that the building in question had collapsed on account of the structural problems noted in the earlier expert reports, as well as its illegal extension subsequent to its construction. It was also stated in the report that the defendants jointly bore 75% of the responsibility for the collapse of the building. The remaining 25% responsibility lay with the Municipality officials on account of their failure to duly inspect the building before issuing it with the necessary permits for occupation.",

Execution of the sentences was suspended pursuant to Article 51 \u00a7 1 of the new Criminal Code (Law no. 5237). Relying on the findings of the later expert report as regards the responsibility of the municipal officials for the collapse of the building, it also decided that a criminal complaint should be filed against the relevant officials with the D\u00fczce public prosecutor\u2019s office. The defendant H.E lodged an appeal against this judgment.",

On 23 October 2007 the Court of Cassation held firstly that the decision of the first-instance court, in so far as it concerned S.E. and T.A., was null and void, since the earlier judgment of 7 June 2005 had already become final in their regard as they had not lodged an appeal. It then went on to uphold the decision to discontinue the proceedings in respect of H.E. only.",

                "27.  As regards the findings in the reports adduced to the criminal case file, the experts noted that the quality of the concrete used in the construction and certain structural elements of the building had been below the required standard. The building had, moreover, been illegally extended after its construction. The municipal officials had failed to duly inspect the building during its construction phase or before issuing the necessary permit for its occupation. They had also failed to carry out a soil survey in the area and to identify the potential \u201cdisaster zones\u201d in the event of an earthquake, with a view to limiting the height of buildings in such areas. The experts concluded that, in view of such failures, the Municipality had been 50% responsible for the collapse of the building in question. On the other hand, it found that the other two defendants had not been at fault.",
                "28.  Relying on that expert report, on 27 June 2007 the Sakarya Administrative Court partially accepted the applicant\u2019s claims against the Municipality, and awarded him TRY 1,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage in accordance with his request, plus interest. It also awarded his wife and daughter TRY 1,000 and TRY 500, respectively, in respect of non\u2011pecuniary damage. It rejected their claims in respect of pecuniary damage as being unfounded.",

                "7.  On 7 September 2007 at 10 p.m. K.M., who was in the early weeks of pregnancy at the time, was at home with her parents and husband when she fainted and began to have convulsions. An ambulance was called, which arrived 40-45 minutes later.",
                "8.  Upon arrival, the ambulance doctor, A.G., found K.M. nearly unconscious, with impaired breathing and low blood pressure. According to the applicant, the doctor was told at that point that K.M. was pregnant. A.G. diagnosed a convulsion syndrome, gave K.M. two injections \u2013 one of relanium and one of magnesium \u2013 and took her to hospital. It appears that neither the doctor nor the nurse nor the driver of the ambulance helped her family carry K.M. downstairs from the eighth floor of the building and put her into the ambulance. Moreover, although K.M. had not regained consciousness after the injections, A.G. chose not to sit beside her during the journey to hospital, but instead sat beside the driver in the driver\u2019s cab.",
                "9.  On the same day A.G. and the nurse drew up an ambulance visit record stating that they had arrived seven minutes after receiving the ambulance call and that they had administered only one medical injection, of relanium.",
                "12.  During the inquiry, the investigator took statements from the medical personnel who had provided assistance to K.M., including A.G., the nurse, and the driver. In particular, in her statement of 14 November 2007 the nurse stated that the doctor had ordered her to administer an injection of magnesium sulphate but that K.M.\u2019s convulsions had continued, after which the doctor had handed her a phial of relanium, which she had injected. In her statement made on the same day A.G. explained that upon arrival they had found K.M. having seizures and that, from talking to her family, she had learnt that K.M. was pregnant. She had then ordered the nurse to inject relanium and, knowing that K.M. was pregnant, she did not inject any other medication and did not take any further measures since she did not consider it necessary in the circumstances.",
                "13.  On 26 November 2007 the ambulance nurse and A.G. were questioned again. The nurse stated, in particular, that the fact that only the injection of relanium and not the one of magnesium had been mentioned in the ambulance visit record could possibly be explained by her having forgotten to remind the doctor about the injection of magnesium. A.G. stated, inter alia, that she had ordered the nurse to give two injections.",
                "14.  In the course of the inquiry the investigator ordered a forensic medical investigation to be carried out by a panel of experts. According to the results of the opinion (forensic medical opinion no. 89) produced on 14 January 2008, the injection of relanium 2 mg and magnesium 3 g by the ambulance crew had been correct at the given moment, taking into account the patient\u2019s condition \u2212 that is to say convulsion syndrome \u2212 and the injection of the given quantity of those substances was not contra-indicated. The opinion also stated that K.M.\u2019s medical treatment had been correct and had corresponded to the diagnosis.",

The decision stated, in particular, that the applicant\u2019s request for an additional forensic medical investigation involving his participation was well-founded.",
                "20.  On 25 April 2008 the investigator decided to reject the institution of criminal proceedings for lack of corpus delicti. The decision stated in particular that the relevant members of the medical personnel, including the emergency care specialists who had provided first aid assistance to K.M., had been questioned. It further reiterated the conclusions of the experts reflected in the forensic medical opinions nos. 89 and 6 and stated that the initial medical assistance administered as first-aid and the subsequent hospital treatment provided to K.M. had been performed properly, appropriately and in a timely manner without any errors or omissions.",
                "21.  On the same day the investigator lodged a request with the director of the \u201cEmergency Medical Service\u201d State Close Joint Stock Company of the Yerevan Municipality (\u201cthe Emergency Medical Service\u201d) seeking to impose an appropriate penalty on the ambulance crew. In particular, the investigator stated that there had been a 40-minute delay before the ambulance arrived and that only one of two injections given to K.M. had been mentioned by the ambulance doctor in the visit record. Furthermore, the process of taking the patient to hospital had been slow and disorganised. The ambulance driver had not carried the patient downstairs and had not assisted in putting her in the ambulance. Instead of sitting beside K.M., whose condition was extremely critical, the doctor had chosen to sit in the driver\u2019s cab next to the driver. The investigator\u2019s conclusion was therefore that the ambulance crew had arrived after a serious delay and had not provided proper medical assistance.",

On 30 April 2008 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Avan and Nor-Nork District Court of Yerevan concerning the investigator\u2019s decision of 25 April 2008 seeking the institution of criminal proceedings against A.G. and the nurse. The applicant submitted, in particular, that the panel of experts performing the additional forensic medical investigation had not taken due account of his arguments, which had been based on relevant medical literature and Government decrees. He reiterated his arguments with regard to the contra-indication of relanium and magnesium in cases of pregnancy and low blood pressure and the other arguments previously submitted in his complaint lodged with the District Prosecutor\u2019s Office.",

On 16 May 2008 the medical council of the Emergency Medical Service held a meeting at which the circumstances described in the investigator\u2019s decision of 25 April 2008 were discussed.

As a result, A.G. received a reprimand for serious breach of work regulations and medical ethics. Also, the head of the relevant emergency department was ordered to improve the supervision of employees as regards respecting work regulations, so as to prevent similar occurrences in future, and to examine every such case.",
                "25.  On 16 July 2008 the applicant lodged an appeal against this decision with the Criminal Court of Appeal. He argued, in particular, that the District Court had failed to question A.G. and the nurse. Furthermore, the District Court had not adequately addressed their arguments concerning the injection of K.M. with substances that were contra-indicated, given her condition, or the over-dosage thereof which, he alleged, had caused her death.",
                "26.  On 4 September 2008 the Criminal Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal and upheld the decision of the District Court. In doing so, it stated that there was no necessity to summon A.G. and the nurse to testify in court since they had already made statements during the inquiry. As regards the applicant\u2019s arguments with regard to the contra\u2011indication of medical substances administered by injection to K.M., the Court of Appeal relied on the forensic medical opinions according to which their administration had been correct, taking into account the convulsion syndrome at that moment.",

                "10.  Various witness testimonies were taken from colleagues, friends and family members of the deceased. In her testimonies dated 12 and 17 March 2005 and 7 February 2006, his fianc\u00e9e stated that she had spoken twice with him on the phone the night preceding his death without noticing anything particular. She expressed the view that he could not possibly have committed suicide, citing the fact that two days before he had asked her to book rooms for an excursion they were planning to make two weeks later and that he had expressed concerns about his mother\u2019s health. Lastly, she stated that about a month before his death he had confided to her that \u201cit was a matter of life and death for him to leave his job with V.\u201d and that \u201cV. was facing a serious problem that threatened its very existence\u201d.",
                "11.  From the testimonies of his colleagues and his fianc\u00e9e it was evident that Mr Tsalikidis was sociable and had been well-respected in his work environment. Even though he had been under a lot of pressure at work, his colleagues expressed doubts as to whether stress could have driven him to suicide. He had expressed a wish to quit his job about a month before his death but had later changed his mind after a few days\u2019 leave. On the night of his death he had sent a work-related email to his colleagues at around 4.30 a.m. The content of the email was unremarkable. It was also alleged that on 7 March 2005 there had been a tense meeting at work in which he, amongst others, had been reprimanded by his superiors. His colleagues also testified that he had been responsible for holding monthly meetings with company E., one of V.\u2019s providers, at which they discussed new versions of software and other technical issues.",
                "12.  Testimony was also taken from coroner F.K., the head of the Forensic Science Service of Athens University. In his statement dated 9 March 2006, he attempted to explain the lack of typical signs of hanging \u2013 such as injuries caused by body spasms or cyanosis of the face \u2013 by attributing the death to cardiac arrest caused by simultaneous pressure to the two carotid arteries. He also mentioned that the rope mark on the deceased man\u2019s neck had been typical in cases of hanging; it had been obliquely directed (\u03bb\u03bf\u03be\u03ac \u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b7) and the knot had been an \u201cordinary, everyday knot\u201d. In his view, a possible exhumation and/or toxicology test would be of no added value.",
                "13.  In the light of the foregoing testimonies and having taken all evidence into account, on 20 June 2006 the public prosecutor at the Athens Court of First Instance issued order no. 80/20-6-06 archiving the case, having concluded that there were no indications of any criminal acts committed against Mr Tsalikidis, even though his death was causally linked with the wiretapping case. On 25 September 2006 the decision was upheld by order no. 565/25-9-06 issued by the public prosecutor at the Court of Appeal following an appeal against it by the first applicant.",
                "14.  On 2 February 2006 the Minister of Public Order made a statement informing the public that since June 2004 (two months before the Olympic Games) the telephones of many state officials had been tapped through spyware that had been implanted in the network of phone operator V. The wiretap, installed by persons unknown, had targeted more than 100 of Greece\u2019s State officials, including the Prime Minister and many senior members of the Cabinet. The spyware diverted phone conversations made by V.\u2019s subscribers to fourteen \u201cshadow\u201d pay-as-you-go mobile phones, allowing calls to be monitored.",
                "15.  Following a parliamentary investigation, it was made known that the unauthorised spyware had been implanted in a software provided by company E. to phone operator V. Mr Tsalikidis had been responsible for accepting the software from E. on behalf of V. and met representatives from E. on a monthly basis in order to discuss new versions of the software and other technical issues.",
                "16.  V. was informed by E. that their network had been used to wiretap State officials on 4 March 2005. On 8 March 2005 G.K., a senior manager with V., ordered that the newly discovered software be deactivated and removed from its systems. On 10 March 2005 he informed the Ministers of Justice and of Public Order and the director of the Prime Minister\u2019s office about the existence of the software. A criminal investigation was ordered but its conclusions are not apparent from the material in the Court\u2019s possession.",
                "17.  The wiretapping affair assumed large dimensions both within and outside Greece, and the investigation was widely reported in the media. Mr Tsalikidis\u2019 death occurred the day after the spyware had been removed from V.\u2019s network and the day before the relevant ministers were informed and this fact was mentioned in all the newspaper articles, suggesting an association between his death and the wiretapping affair without his involvement in the case being established.",
                "18.  On 8 February 2012, citing new evidence, the applicants requested that the public prosecutor at the Athens Court of First Instance reopen the case file for the purposes either of initiating criminal proceedings in rem for intentional homicide and/or exposure to peril and/or felonious extortion, or for launching a supplementary preliminary investigation into the aforementioned offences or any other offence that might have been committed. The applicants also declared that they wished to join the proceedings as civil parties.",
                "19.  The first evidence submitted by the applicants was a forensic report dated 12 November 2010 prepared at their request by a British expert, Dr S.K. The expert wrote his report \u2212 in English \u2212 on the basis of his examination of a number of documents from the case file which had been translated into that language. The relevant parts of his report read as follows:\n\u201c... 2. In forming my opinion I have had to rely on a relatively limited group of materials including the original autopsy report translated by Mr Peter Tsalikidis, a set of colour scene photographs (it is not clear to me who took these photographs), scans of white and black photos showing an unclothed body with a ligature mark on mid\u2011-neck (the detail is poor) and a website videos that were produced for an expos\u00e9 produced by the Al-Jazeera network.\n... 5. On April 8 I received two emails from Mr Tsalikidis. The first was an extract of comments taken from a report issued by the Forensic Institute in Athens. The report states that the ligature was \u201cupwardly directed\u201d, a statement that appears to be contradicted by the photographs I have seen. Mr Tsalikidis also claims he was told that \u201cthe death was instant because of simultaneous pressure to the carotid bags (sic - this should be \u2018arteries\u2019)\u201d. This statement, too, is inconsistent with the normal colouration of the face as shown in the photographs. 6. On March 29 I was sent a link to a website dedicated to this case... The video also contains several images and statements that are confusing. These include (1) photograph of the suspensory knot \u2013 it is a complex knot, and definitely not the sort of knots seen in routine suicides. I do not know if the deceased possessed the requisite skills needed to tie such a complex knot. The video narrator stated that the body was hanging 3 inches from the floor. In spite of the short distance, it is possible for someone to hang themselves at this low height. In fact, it is not uncommon.\n... 8. ... The photographs do show that the deceased was unclothed; they also showed an obvious ligature mark that was located in mid-neck, parallel to the shoulders.\n...\nGross Autopsy Findings 10. Neither the height nor the weight of the deceased was supplied. Neither the core temperature of the cadaver nor the ambient room temperature was recorded. It appears that the autopsy was performed the next day, but whether the cadaver was refrigerated is not stated and, since core temperature was not obtained, it would have been irrelevant anyway. No attempt whatsoever was made to identify the time of death... No fibres were taken from the ligature for identification and no tissue taken from the ligature were taken for microscopic examination.\nDiscussion 1. The position of the rope mark is more consistent with strangulation than hanging \u2013 in cases of strangulation the ligature mark, as it was here, tends to encircle the entire neck without deviation upward or downward, and almost invariable there is a gap where the rope suspends the body. Hanging marks are almost always higher on the neck than strangulation marks. The marks present here are more consistent with strangulation. 2. From the photographs I saw there was no evidence of hypostasis (accumulation of blood in the legs that is to be expected after a normal hanging). This argues strongly against hanging.\n... 4. Perhaps more importantly, one expects to see some sort of soft tissue damage within the underlying neck. Injuries are present in at least 1/3 of hangings. No damage was seen within the neck, which is worrisome. The absence of soft tissue injury does not rule out hanging, but if it had been present, a much more convincing case for strangulation could have been made. 5. Damage to the lining of the great vessels in the neck is a frequent finding in strangulation, but that examination was never performed (in fact, no microscopic examination was performed). This means the autopsy was incomplete by U.S. and EU standards. 6. The colour of the face could only be described as normal; typically, victims of manual strangulation will have deeply congested haemorrhagic faces, but victims of hanging often have pale faces \u2013 in this particular instance the colour of the face is so normal that it almost appears that neither strangulation nor hanging occurred. 7. While adequate examination is not possible only from inspecting photographs, the knot used to anchor the rope appears quite complex. This might be expected if the deceased had nautical experience, but the family insists he did not. 8. Homicidal hanging is very rare, since it is very difficult for one person to hang another, unless of course they had been drugged first. The autopsy report says that blood and urine were tested for alcohol and that the results show the deceased had been drinking (post-mortem alcohol production of that magnitude does not occur that quickly). I think it would be very important to know if any other drugs were present. If testing was not done at the time of autopsy, exhumation and testing of the hair is still possible. The results, whether positive or negative, would be definitive. 9. The medical examiner commented on the presence of pulmonary oedema. Such may occur after hanging, but histological studies have shown that pulmonary oedema is much more common after strangulation. 10. There were no scratch marks on the neck, suggesting the deceased made no effort to claw the rope away from his neck. This is also consistent with his having been sedated.\nDiscussion\nObviously, there is no evidence of forceful strangulation and, in the absence of visible trauma, homicidal hanging would appear to be out of the question. The fact that there was minimal suspension does not rule out suicide. Having said that, the case has a number of disturbing features: (1) the autopsy was grossly inadequate, and even if signs of homicide had been present, they would have been missed; (2) the face was of normal colour \u2013 neither congested nor pale; this argues for death before hanging; (3) there was no accumulation of blood in the lower extremities \u2013 this absence argues against hanging altogether; (4) the furrow around the neck is in a position more often seen in strangulation than suicide; (5) none of the normal scratch marks normally seen outside of the neck when individuals hang themselves were evident. Nor, according to the autopsy pathologist, there none of the soft tissue injuries that are normally expected in hanging. Two other issues are of concern: (1) was the deceased able to tie the complex knot used to support him, and (2) it appears that complete toxicology testing (was not) performed and that is a very serious omission. There are many poisons that are not detected by routine tests \u2013 they are only identified if they are specifically sought. In the absence to these questions, the possibility of murder must be strongly considered. The most likely scenario, based on the evidence at hand, is that the deceased was sedated/poisoned and hung after death.\u201d",
                "20.  The second evidence adduced by the applicants was an undated report produced at the applicants\u2019 request by Coroner Th.V. His report was prepared on the basis of the documents in the criminal case file.",
                "27.  By document no. E 2006/1200/29-2-2012, issued by the public prosecutor at the Athens Court of First Instance on 29 February 2012 and addressed to the public prosecutor at the Athens Court of Appeal, approval was sought to reopen the case file pursuant to Article 43 \u00a7 3 (a) and Article 47 \u00a7 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. On 7 March 2012 the request was granted and a supplementary preliminary investigation was ordered.",
                "28.  On 20 April 2012 the public prosecutor at the Athens Court of First Instance ordered the exhumation of Mr Tsalikidis\u2019 body, the conduct of a new forensic autopsy and the execution of all laboratory tests to be carried out in a laboratory in the presence of the technical advisors appointed by the applicants.",
                "29.  The exhumation took place on 3 May 2012 in the presence of coroners I.B., N.K. and Ch.S. and the applicants\u2019 technical advisor Th.V., and biological material was sent to the Universities of Athens and Crete for the purpose of conducting toxicology tests. According to toxicology report no. 1313/7-12-2012, drawn up on 7 December 2012 by the Forensic Science Laboratory of the Toxicology Unit of the University of Crete, and forensic report no. 865/25-11-2013 on the exhumed body, drawn up on 25 November 2013 by the Forensic and Toxicology Laboratory of the School of Medicine of Athens University, the results were negative as regards the presence of poison or medication. However, in both reports it was stressed that the absence of a positive finding did not preclude the possibility of the administration of poison or medication to the deceased, since a number of factors, such as the lapse of time, could have affected the results.",
                "32.  The applicants also requested that a psychiatric report be included in the case file, and one was duly prepared at their request. Dr A.D. studied the case file documents and conducted interviews with the first applicant and the deceased\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. His report dated 12 April 2012 stated that the deceased did not betray any of the personality characteristics associated with a suicide risk. In addition, no other factors such as health issues or financial problems were detected as being of concern, and in general, no plausible grounds for suicide were identified. In the doctor\u2019s opinion, his support system of friends and family, his short-term (excursion) and long\u2011term (wedding) plans, together with the absence of any risk factors, were all indications that Mr Tsalikidis did not commit suicide.",
                "33.  On 16 June 2014 the public prosecutor at the Athens Court of First Instance, with the approval of the public prosecutor at the Court of Appeal, closed the supplementary investigation, concluding that the above\u2011mentioned reports, considered in conjunction with the evidence gathered during the main investigation, were sufficient to allow the case file to be archived, thereby upholding the conclusions of order 80/06 issued by the public prosecutor at the Athens Court of First Instance (order no. 14/3859/16-6-2014)."

                "7.  In 2004 Mr R. arrived at correctional colony no. 4 in the Arkhangelsk Region where he was to serve his twelve-year sentence. On admission to that facility, he underwent a general medical check-up permed by a prison doctor who concluded that he was healthy. Two routine chest X-ray examinations in March and October 2004 confirmed that conclusion.",
                "10.  The next day Mr R. underwent a sputum test, which revealed his affliction with tuberculosis combined with pneumonia. Treatment with five first-line drugs was prescribed. It was started about two weeks later, but had no effect on Mr R.\u2019s health.",
                "11.  On 12 April 2005 a drug susceptibility test was performed. The test result was only received on 18 July 2005 (see paragraph 15 below). An additional chest X-ray examination on 18 April 2005 indicated further progress of the diseases.",
                "12.  In the light of the above, on 23 April 2005 Mr R. was transferred to the Arkhangelsk regional prison tuberculosis hospital (\u201cregional prison hospital\u201d), where his treatment continued as previously prescribed.",
                "14.  In the meantime, regular chest X-ray examinations showed that Mr R.\u2019s health was continuing to deteriorate. By mid-July 2005 pulmonary cavities had appeared, and his condition had become serious.",
                "15.  On 18 July 2005 the regional prison hospital received the result of the drug susceptibility test of 12 April 2005. It revealed that Mr R.\u2019s tuberculosis was resistant to four antibiotics being used in his treatment.",
                "16.  According to a medical entry made at the top of a page outside the related fields in Mr R.\u2019s medical file, on 28 July 2005 he was prescribed treatment with advanced antibiotics. There are no regular entries showing the actual intake of the new drugs.",
                "19.  On 21 October 2006 the Primorskiy Inter-District Prosecutor\u2019s Office refused to open a criminal case. Its page-long decision was based on the autopsy report and general information on Mr R.\u2019s treatment submitted by the prison medical authorities. The investigator concluded that Mr R. had died of tuberculosis for which he had received medical treatment, and that the patient\u2019s detention in a northern region had not breached Russian law.",
                "21.  By a letter of 9 January 2007 a prosecutor informed the applicant that a criminal inquiry had established that his son had contracted tuberculosis in early March 2005. The correctional colony had promptly identified the disease and had ensured treatment keeping the disease under control. The investigating authorities did not assess the quality of the medical services provided between late April and September 2005.",
                "22.  The applicant appealed against the decision of 21 October 2006, insisting that the investigator\u2019s finding had not been supported by expert evidence. He further argued that the detention authorities had failed not only to diagnose his son\u2019s tuberculosis promptly, but also to provide him with adequate care in the regional prison hospital.",
                "23.  On 3 July 2007 the Isakogorskiy District Court of Arkhangelsk examined the claim. Ms B., the head of the regional prison hospital\u2019s unit responsible for Mr R.\u2019s treatment, was heard. She stated that Mr R. had been admitted to the hospital on 23 April 2005. Shortly thereafter he had undergone medical testing. Ms B. stressed that the testing had been complex and that the hospital had only received the test result in August 2005. On 26 August 2005 the doctors had learned that Mr R.\u2019s tuberculosis had been drug resistant. They had prescribed treatment with advanced antibiotics. However, by that time pathological changes in the patient\u2019s body had already become irreversible.",
                "24.  Having regard to the investigation file, the court noted that the investigating authorities had solicited neither the autopsy report nor medical documents concerning Mr R.\u2019s treatment and that they had not interviewed any doctor involved in the treatment. The court thus concluded that the criminal inquiry had not been thorough. It overruled the prosecutor\u2019s decision of 21 October 2006 not to open a criminal case.",
                "25.  On 14 August 2007 the Arkhangelsk Regional Court quashed the District Court\u2019s decision on appeal. It noted that it was not for the investigative authorities to assess all possible versions of the events and that there was no obligation on them to resolve each inconsistency in the case. The court found that the documents obtained by the first\u2011instance court and the statement by Ms B. had remedied the alleged shortcomings in the investigation. The case was remitted to the District Court for a fresh examination.",
                "26.  Ten days later the District Court re-examined the case. It concluded that the criminal inquiry had been carried out in compliance with the requirements of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure, and that the impugned decision of 21 October 2006 had been based on sufficient evidence duly assessed by the investigating authorities. The applicant\u2019s claim was accordingly rejected.",
                "27.  On 23 November 2007 the Regional Court upheld the above\u2011mentioned decision on appeal."

There is a shower head installed in each of the toilets. Nine other photographs show the room for the taking of police statements, the room used for interviews between arrestees and their lawyers, and the identification parade room. Lastly, nine further photographs show the detention rooms and the hall. It is apparent that the detention rooms are separated from the hall by bars. There are no beds in the detention rooms but along their three walls there are concrete benches topped with a cushion. On the benches there are blankets, apparently used both for covering and as pillows. The detention rooms do not have windows but appear to receive light from the hall.

The Standards of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cthe CPT\u201d) concerning the conditions of detention of foreign nationals (see the CPT standards, document no. CPT/Inf(97)10-part) provide, in so far as relevant, as follows:\n\u201c27.  In certain countries, CPT delegations have found immigration detainees held in police stations for prolonged periods (for weeks and, in certain cases, months), subject to mediocre material conditions of detention, deprived of any form of activity and on occasion obliged to share cells with criminal suspects. Such a situation is indefensible. 28.  The CPT recognises that, in the very nature of things, immigration detainees may have to spend some time in an ordinary police detention facility. However, conditions in police stations will frequently - if not invariably - be inadequate for prolonged periods of detention. Consequently, the period of time spent by immigration detainees in such establishments should be kept to the absolute minimum. 29.  In the view of the CPT, in those cases where it is deemed necessary to deprive persons of their liberty for an extended period under aliens legislation, they should be accommodated in centres specifically designed for that purpose, offering material conditions and a regime appropriate to their legal situation and staffed by suitably-qualified personnel. 30.  Obviously, such centres should provide accommodation which is adequately-furnished, clean and in a good state of repair, and which offers sufficient living space for the numbers involved. Further, care should be taken in the design and layout of the premises to avoid as far as possible any impression of a carceral environment. As regards regime activities, they should include outdoor exercise, access to a day room and to radio/television and newspapers/magazines, as well as other appropriate means of recreation (e.g. board games, table tennis). The longer the period for which persons are detained, the more developed should be the activities which are offered to them.\n... 79.  Conditions of detention for irregular migrants should reflect the nature of their deprivation of liberty, with limited restrictions in place and a varied regime of activities. For example, detained irregular migrants ... should be restricted in their freedom of movement within the detention facility as little as possible.\u201d"

In 2002 the National Anti-Corruption Prosecution Service commenced proceedings against the applicant on charges of involvement in a vast criminal network operating in the economic field, involving several dozen individuals and some one hundred business companies. With the complicity of bank employees, fraudulent appropriations were granted to those companies, which money was then misused for the benefit of the accused.",
                "8.  By final judgment of 28 February 2013 the High Court of Cassation and Justice convicted the applicant on conspiracy charges, sentencing him to three years, four months\u2019 imprisonment.",

At that time the illness had already reached an advanced stage and the applicant displayed bone metastases, brain haematoma and intraocular haemorrhages. On 27 November 2012 the applicant had been admitted to the Bucharest Institute of Oncology, from which he had been discharged on 11 January 2013. From 14 to 18 January 2013 he had once again been admitted to hospital. He had undergone prostate surgery and begun chemotherapy. He had subsequently had several short stays in hospital. In January 2013 the diagnosis reached by the oncologist had emphasised the seriousness of the applicant\u2019s condition. The prognosis was that he had a short time to live given that the disease had spread to the bone, for which condition the existing treatment was insufficient. On 26 February 2013 the applicant was examined by a medical board, which issued him with a certificate of severe disability.",
                "10.  On 28 February 2013 the applicant was taken into Bac\u0103u Hospital oncology department. His state had worsened and he was suffering from bone pain. The applicant continued his chemotherapy and remained in hospital until 4 March 2013, when he was handed over to police officers who had come to escort him to Bac\u0103u Prison where he was to begin serving his sentence.",

At the board\u2019s request, the applicant underwent several medical examinations, which showed that his condition required radiotherapy sessions and further chemotherapy. Furthermore, it transpired from the medical documents made available to the committee that the applicant had had chemotherapy sessions at Bac\u0103u Hospital on 12 April 2013 and at the Bucharest Institute of Oncology on 10 and 17 May 2013.",
                "15.  On 25 June 2013 the court allowed the applicant\u2019s request and ordered a three-month interruption of his sentence. Having regard to the seriousness of the applicant\u2019s illness, it ruled that hospitalisation under supervision would considerably reduce his chances of survival and recovery owing to the stress and mental suffering caused by the continued execution of his sentence. Moreover, the court emphasised that the applicant posed no threat to public order, that the sentence, one third of which had already been served, was reasonably short and that the applicant\u2019s conduct had been good throughout the criminal proceedings. The prosecution appealed.",
                "16.  The applicant was released on the same day. On 4 and 19 July 2013 he underwent chemotherapy at Bac\u0103u Hospital and continued the treatment on 1 and 16 August 2013 at the Bucharest Institute of Oncology.",
                "18.  On 31 August 2013 the applicant was imprisoned in Bac\u0103u to serve his sentence. On 24 September 2013 he was transferred to Vaslui Prison. On 27 September 2013 he was admitted to the Rahova Prison hospital. On 3 October 2013 he returned to Vaslui Prison.",

On the same day, noting the deterioration in the applicant\u2019s general condition, a multidisciplinary team from the T\u00e2rgu Ocna Prison hospital placed a prisoner on constant standby to assist the applicant in his everyday activities.

The senior medical officer said that the applicant\u2019s condition could deteriorate suddenly and that he therefore needed round-the-clock medical care. From 25 to 27 November 2013 the applicant received palliative care in the same hospital before being transferred to Bac\u0103u Prison and then to the T\u00e2rgu Ocna Prison hospital.",

In a report drawn up at the Government agent\u2019s request, the senior medical officer at the Bac\u0103u Hospital oncology department highlighted certain dysfunctions in the administration of the treatment. Drawing on the medical files relating to the applicant\u2019s stays in that hospital, he pointed out that on 14 March 2013 the applicant had begun the chemotherapy without having received the radiotherapy recommended by the doctors in his department. He added that the chemotherapy session scheduled for between 28 and 30 March 2013 had not taken place because the applicant had been absent, having been transferred to the Bucharest Institute of Oncology for examinations. Lastly, he noted that on 18 September 2013 the applicant had arrived late at the hospital to continue his chemotherapy. Furthermore, when the applicant had been hospitalised, he had been guarded by two police officers and had remained handcuffed to the bed, even after he had become blind and deaf and was suffering extreme bone pain.",

The institute\u2019s senior medical officer stated in the report that the applicant had duly respected all his medical appointments and that during his stays at the institute he had not been constrained but had been guarded by prison officers."

He also stated that he had been beaten up and had received all his injuries at the Severnyy police department, but had not been subjected to any ill\u2011treatment at the Sovetskiy police department, and had no complaints against its officers. The applicant was then taken to the place where he had allegedly hidden I.\u2019s body.

The applicant reiterated his earlier self\u2011incriminating statements, as well as the statements concerning his ill\u2011treatment at the Severnyy police department. He also stated that he had burnt I.\u2019s body after he had strangled her. Between 11.30 a.m. and 1.32 p.m. his statements were verified at the scene of the crime by investigator S. in the presence of lawyer P. and operative officers of the Sovetskiy police department.

An investigator of that prosecutor\u2019s office carried out a pre-investigation inquiry and refused to institute criminal proceedings into the applicant\u2019s complaint.

In the most recent refusal of 29 September 2006 to institute criminal proceedings for lack of evidence that the officers of the Severnyy police department had committed a crime, the investigator established the facts as follows, relying on the police officers\u2019 statements. On 17 June 2006 certain operative officers of the criminal search unit of the Severnyy police department carried out operational-search activities in connection with I.\u2019s disappearance. In order to check the applicant\u2019s involvement in I.\u2019s disappearance they took him to the Severnyy police department with his consent and interviewed him. After receiving his \u201cexplanation\u201d M. released him. That evening M. took him to the police station again for swearing on the street near the police station. From 9.50 p.m. on 17 June until 10.40 a.m. on 19 June 2006 the applicant was detained in a cell for administrative offenders. He was then taken to the Sovetskiy police department. No physical force was used against him, and no complaints were made by him.",

The investigator noted that on the two occasions the applicant had been taken to the Severnyy police department \u2013 first, for giving statements in relation to I.\u2019s disappearance, and second, for having committed the administrative offence \u2013 he had had no injuries. In the same decision the investigator suggested that the applicant\u2019s injuries could have been inflicted by a third party outside the Severnyy police department, between 17 and 19 June 2006, between one and three days before his medical examination by the forensic expert on 20 June 2006.",

The District Court dismissed the request, noting that all investigative measures since the applicant\u2019s arrest as a suspect on 20 June 2006 had been carried out in the presence of lawyer P. Moreover, there was no evidence that the applicant had rejected her services. Following his confession, recorded in his \u201cexplanation\u201d to the investigator of 19 June 2006, the applicant had shown where he had hidden I.\u2019s body, which had not required the presence of a lawyer. The court based its findings on the self\u2011incriminating statements given by the applicant in the preliminary investigation, noting that his allegations of ill\u2011treatment in police custody had been examined and dismissed by the Sovetskiy and Kominternovskiy district prosecutor\u2019s offices in decisions of 21 and 29 September 2006 respectively.",

The first and second applicants, Mr S.F. and Mrs W.O., born respectively in 1975 and 1978, are spouses. The other three applicants, Mr Y.F., Mr S.F. and Mr A.F., born respectively in 1999, 2004 and 2014, are their sons.",
                "6.  On 14 August 2015 the applicants, who had fled from Iraq, covertly crossed the Turkish-Bulgarian border. They were travelling with four other families. From there, they took taxis which drove them to the outskirts of Sofia, where they slept under the open sky for two nights. On 17 August 2015, they hired other taxis to drive them to the Bulgarian-Serbian border, somewhere around the town of Bregovo. Shortly before the border, the applicants switched cars, getting into a Toyota sports utility vehicle, which was supposed to take them through a wooded area to the border itself. They intended to cross that border covertly as well, and from there continue towards Western Europe.",
                "7.  At that time, the second applicant was three months pregnant.",
                "8.  According to media reports, over the last few years the above\u2011mentioned route has been a popular one for migrants trying to cross Bulgaria covertly on their way to Western Europe. According to a report submitted by the Government, in August 2015 the Bulgarian border police intercepted 350 adult migrants and 132 minor migrants near Bregovo and took them into custody.",
                "9.  In the late afternoon of 17 August 2015 the applicants were driven in the Toyota towards the Bulgarian-Serbian border near the village of Rabrovo, which is about fifteen kilometres south of Bregovo, twenty-five kilometres west of the town of Vidin, and about two kilometres from the border. It was also transporting the four other families; together with the applicants, it carried a total of eighteen passengers, eight of whom were minors.",
                "10.  At about 5 p.m., when the Toyota was just a few metres away from the border, two officers of the Bulgarian border police intercepted it. The driver fled. One of the officers gave chase, while the other ordered all the passengers to step out of the vehicle. The first officer could not catch up with the driver and came back. According to the applicants, he was apparently annoyed about his inability to detain the driver and hit one of the passengers. The applicants submitted that they had been afraid that he might hit them as well.",
                "16.  The video was submitted by the applicants on a digital video disk containing two video files. One is in .mpg format and bears a time stamp according to which it was last modified at 5.36 p.m. on 17 September \u200e2015; and the other is in .mp4 format and bears a time stamp according to which it was last modified at 3.27 p.m. on 15 December 2015. The footage in both files is identical, except that: (a) the faces of the applicants in the first one have been pixelated (whereas in the second they have not); (b) the running time of the first video is one minute and twenty-one seconds (whereas that of the second is one minute and thirty-two seconds, as it continues for another ten seconds); and (c) in the first file the footage is horizontal whereas in the second it is rotated to the right at a ninety-degree angle. The footage in the first file has a definition of 1,280 by 720 pixels and is at twenty-four frames per second, whereas that in the second file has a definition of 1,920 by 1,080 pixels and is at twenty-nine frames per second.",
                "17.  The applicants explained that the above-mentioned dates and times corresponded with when they had copied the video files in Switzerland, and that they had in fact recorded the original video on 18 August 2015, at about noon. Since they had taken the SIM cards out of the mobile telephone several times in the course of their journey and then re-inserted them, the telephone had not indicated the correct time and date, making it impossible to pinpoint the exact date and time when the video had been recorded.",
                "18.  In a letter to the Government Agent, an official from the Migration Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Sofia, having compared the video footage with the photographs in the applicants\u2019 migration files, stated that he could confirm that the applicants were indeed the people featured in the video.",
                "19.  According to the Government, the border police\u2019s detention facility in Vidin was equipped in accordance with the relevant regulations. They did not provide further details in that respect.",
                "21.  About four hours later, at about 10 p.m., officers came and took the first applicant to another building in order to take his picture and to digitally fingerprint him. After that, the officers took out the second applicant for fingerprinting. After the fingerprinting procedure, the officers left the applicants in the cell for the night.",
                "22.  Between 10.30 a.m. and 11 a.m. and between 11 a.m. and 11.30 a.m. the next day, 18 August 2015, a border police investigator interviewed respectively the first and the second applicants. The interviews were conducted in English and translated into Bulgarian with the help of an interpreter.",
                "23.  According to the applicants, after the interview the second applicant asked the guards to give her back her bag, so that she could prepare a baby bottle for her toddler (the fifth applicant), and the guards did so. The Government did not comment on that point.",
                "28.  The next day, 19 August 2015, the applicants were served with orders for the first and second applicants\u2019 removal from Bulgaria and for their detention pending removal, all issued the previous day. It does not appear that separate orders were issued with respect to the third, fourth and fifth applicants, who were mentioned as accompanied minors in the orders for the first and second applicants\u2019 detention (see paragraph 33 below).",
                "29.  According to the applicants, at about midday on 19 August 2015 they were given back their belongings and driven to an immigration detention facility in Sofia. According to the Government, that happened much earlier that day, at about 6 a.m. or 7 a.m., since the relevant records showed that the applicants had been placed in the detention facility in Sofia at 2.45 p.m., and the normal travel time between the two facilities was about six or seven hours.",
                "30.  On 24 August 2015 the applicants sought international protection in Bulgaria. Their applications were registered by the State Agency for Refugees on 31 August 2015, and they were released from the immigration detention facility in Sofia and settled in an open facility for the accommodation of asylum-seekers. On 23 September 2015 those proceedings were, however, discontinued because the applicants had vanished from the facility.",
                "31.  In the meantime, the applicants made their way to Switzerland, where they likewise sought international protection on 8 September 2015. On 8 January 2016 the Swiss authorities decided not to examine their applications but rather to transfer them back to Bulgaria under Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third\u2011country national or a stateless person (\u201cthe Dublin III Regulation\u201d), which also applies to Switzerland (see A.S. v. Switzerland, no. 39350/13, \u00a7\u00a7 12-13, 30 June 2015). Following legal challenges by the applicants, on 7 July 2016 the Swiss authorities varied their own decision and proceeded with the examination of the applications. Just over a year later, on 27 July 2017, the applicants were granted asylum in Switzerland."

On 20 January 2016 the Ministry of Justice of Kosovo requested the applicant\u2019s extradition. According to the arrest warrant, the applicant was suspected of aggravated murder under Article 147 \u00a7 7 in conjunction with Article 24 of the Kosovo Criminal Code. He had allegedly ordered L.Q. in July 2010 to murder S.Lu. (his former brother-in-law) for a payment of 30,000 euros (EUR). On 3 August 2010 L.Q. fired gunshots at a car in the vicinity of the intended victim S.Lu., but instead killed N.Lu., S.Lu.\u2019s cousin.",

It found that the new evidence the applicant had produced in the proceedings before it were a matter for the pending reopening proceedings, not for requesting a renewal of the extradition proceedings. In relation to the alleged violations of Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention in the event of his extradition, the Supreme Court found that mere allegations referencing general reports on the human rights situation were not capable of substantiating a real and immediate risk to the applicant under these provisions. Furthermore, the Supreme Court held that the applicant did not have a right under the law to request suspensive effect, which is why that request had to be rejected.",

The court found that the applicant had failed to produce objective evidence which would have indicated a real and immediate risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention if extradited to Kosovo and therefore would have warranted a reopening of the extradition proceedings. While the sworn statement by L.Q. in principle raised doubts in relation to the suspicions against the applicant, it had not constituted the only evidence against him. More pertinent had been the fact that, during the criminal proceedings against L.Q. in Kosovo, a microcassette had been put into evidence by S.Lu. which had allegedly contained a conversation confirming his statements that the applicant had been to blame for the murder. In addition, L.Q.\u2019s initial incriminating statements against the applicant had been made in the presence of his lawyer. Moreover, L.Q. had not specified what exactly the police had allegedly done to him, which had made it impossible to evaluate whether the alleged treatment had actually amounted to torture, inhuman or degrading treatment. The Court of Appeal reiterated that it was in any event for the Kosovo courts to evaluate the evidence against the applicant. In sum, it confirmed that the statement by L.Q. was not capable of immediately dispelling the suspicion against the applicant on which the extradition request was based. Lastly, the Court of Appeal found that despite not being a State Party to the Convention or the Council of Europe, Article 22 of the Constitution of Kosovo granted the Convention direct effect under and superiority to national law, therefore domestic law equally offered protection from violations of the Convention. The Court of Appeal\u2019s decision to dismiss the applicant\u2019s appeal was served on his counsel on 30 January 2017."

On 23 July 2015 the Government submitted their response and attached a document issued by the Office of International Affairs of the US Department of Justice called \u201csupplemental information to Spain on Sentencing Issues in Relation to Andres Lopez Elorza, a/k/a \u2018Andres Lopez Flores\u2019 (hereinafter, \u201cthe US report\u201d). The report stated the following:\n\u201cBy way of introduction, Lopez Elorza\u2019s extradition is sought in order for him to stand trial on federal narcotics offenses in the Eastern District of New York. In essence, Lopez Elorza, a veterinarian, is charged with having been a member of a conspiracy between September 2004 and January 2005, the goal of which was to import heroin into the United States for subsequent distribution, in which Lopez Elorza\u2019s role was to surgically implant packages of liquid heroin into the bodies of dogs that later were transported to the United States. The charges followed the search, in January 2005, of a farm Lopez Elorza operated in Medellin, Colombia, in which law enforcement authorities seized six puppies into which three kilograms of liquid heroin had been surgically implanted. The six puppies were bound for the United States, and the heroin they carried was surgically removed. After the search of his farm, Lopez Elorza fled Colombia.\u201d",
                "32.  As regards the first question put to the Government, the US report argued that there were pretrial factors that could affect the applicant\u2019s sentencing. In particular, the report noted the following:\n\u201cBefore any trial, Lopez Elorza could, with the advice of his lawyer, decide to give up the right to a trial and plead guilty to the charges in the indictment, with or without the agreement of the prosecution. See Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(a). A timely admission of guilt is a factor which could reduce the sentence the judge decides to impose following a conviction. In the United States, the vast majority of criminal cases are resolved by guilty pleas. Lopez Elorza may seek to reach an agreement with the prosecution wherein he would plead guilty in exchange for certain favorable actions, such as an agreement to allow him to plead guilty to fewer than all the charges in the indictment (with the remainder of the charges to be dismissed at sentencing), or even to lesser charges, or in exchange for the government\u2019s promise to affirmatively recommend to the court that a particular lesser sentence be imposed. The agreement may also include the parties\u2019 recommendation as to the appropriate sentence that - depending upon the type of plea agreement that is negotiated - may or may not bind the judge regarding the sentence that will be imposed. Such agreements are within the discretion of the government to enter into, and the judge may also decline to approve an agreement she or he does not believe to be in the interests of justice. The agreement may include, inter alia, an agreement to cooperate with U.S. authorities. Thus, if Lopez Elorza were willing and able to provide substantial assistance to the United States in the investigation or prosecution of another person who had committed a crime, a plea agreement might include a promise by the government attorneys, in exchange for his guilty plea, to file a motion with the court asking that Lopez Elorza\u2019s cooperation be taken into account and permitting the Court to impose a lower sentence that it might otherwise impose. Title 18, United States Code, Section 3553(e); United States Sentencing Guidelines, Section 5K1.1. In such cases, it is not atypical for a judge to impose a sentence that is significantly less than the Guidelines recommendation.\u201d",
                "33.  It also observed that \u201c[i]f, however, Lopez Elorza decides not to plead guilty and instead exercise his right to a trial, and if he is found guilty of one or more charges, his sentencing exposure will vary, depending on the nature of the charges on which he is found guilty. Moreover, the judge will have broad discretion to determine the appropriate sentence [...]\u201d.",
                "34.  As regards the estimated sentence that the applicant could face, the US report stated firstly that, \u201cIn imposing a sentence in a federal criminal case, the judge must consult the U.S. Federal Sentencing Guidelines\u201d. It added that the Guidelines were advisory since the judge had \u201cthe discretion to impose a sentence outside the applicable Guidelines range so long as the court states \u2018with specificity,\u2019 both at sentencing and in the written judgment and commitment order, its reason for doing so\u201d. It additionally stated that, \u201c[b]oth the defendant and the government have the statutory right to appeal any sentence imposed on the grounds that it is substantively or procedurally unreasonable under the circumstances of the case\u201d. Moreover, the decision whether to sentence a person convicted of multiple counts concurrently or consecutively was at the discretion of the court. Section 3584 of Title 18 of the US Code, states, in part, that \u201c[m]ultiple terms of imprisonment imposed at the same time run concurrently unless the court orders or the statute mandates that the terms are to run consecutively\u201d. The report further stressed the following:\n\u201cPrior to sentencing, a probation officer will prepare a presentence report that contains information about the defendant\u2019s offense, his criminal history, other background information, and a calculation of the advisory sentencing range under the Sentencing Guidelines. The defendant has the right to object to the information and conclusion in the present report. Later, during the sentencing phase of the proceedings, defense counsel will be able to present to the judge various mitigating factors to consider that may result in the reduction of his sentence. Specifically, under Title 18, United States Code, Section 3553(a), in determining the particular sentence imposed on a defendant, the court shall consider: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to promote respect for the law, punishment for the offense, deter the defendant or others from committing similar criminal conduct, and the need to protect the public; (3) the kinds of sentences available; (4) the applicable guideline range; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment; (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities; and (7) the need to provide restitution to the victims of the offense(s). In assisting the court in considering the above seven factors, defense counsel will be able to present to the court in detail any mitigating factors relating to these criteria. This would enable the defense to provide to the sentencing court information regarding Lopez Elorza\u2019s background and circumstances, including: his family environment and relationships, the environment in which he was raised, his work history,... socioeconomic factors including educational opportunities or lack thereof, his physical and psychological well-being and any past or current treatment, prior criminal conduct, if any, and any resultant rehabilitative programs and periods of probation, incarceration, and parole, as well as Lopez Elorza\u2019s longterm educational, vocational, and sociological goals\u201d.",
                "37.  The report concluded that while it was possible that any available maximum sentence could be imposed for an offence, under the circumstances present in this case, \u201cthe risk of L\u00f3pez Elorza receiving such a sentence is low\u201d.",
                "41.  On 31 July 2015 the interim measures under Rule 39 were extended and the Court requested that the Government stay the applicant\u2019s extradition to the United States while the proceedings were pending before the Court."

                "5.  The applicant was born in 1979 and lives in Korostyshiv.",
                "6.  The applicant, at the relevant time a judge of the Radomyshl District Court (\u201cthe District Court\u201d), was convicted of abuse of office for having exploited a certain Mr I. as a worker on the renovation of his father\u2019s house under the following circumstances. In April 2007 the applicant, having sentenced I. to fifteen days\u2019 imprisonment for disorderly conduct, had the site manager for the house renovation, Mr Sh., check I. out of the police detention facility (\u201cthe facility\u201d) where the latter was serving his sentence and take him to the construction site where he was to work under Sh.\u2019s direction. Then, in November 2007, a police officer, G., conspired with the applicant in drawing up a report falsely accusing I. of another episode of disorderly conduct. G. fabricated written statements by false witnesses, P.S. and I.A., incriminating I., and submitted the file to the applicant. Knowing that I. was innocent and the report was false, the applicant convicted I. and sentenced him to another fifteen days\u2019 detention. The same scheme was used to exploit I. on the construction site.",
                "7.  On 21 November 2007 officers of the Security Service discovered I. on the construction site in Sh.\u2019s company.",
                "8.  According to the transcript of his statement dated 23 January 2008, which was also video-recorded, Sh. stated that the applicant had employed him to work on his father\u2019s house, that in April 2007 I. had worked on the site on terms he had negotiated with the applicant and that in November I. had worked while serving his fifteen-day sentence. The applicant had instructed Sh. to collect I. from the detention facility, so he had done so. The statement was signed by Sh. on the first and second pages, where his rights as a witness were explained. The statement consists of three more type-written pages containing the transcript of the interview but is not signed by Sh. at the end. It contains a note by the investigator to the effect that Sh. did not sign because he failed to appear when summoned by the investigator. The file contains a report of the same date, signed by Sh., to the effect that he had watched the video recording of his interview and had no comment to make.",
                "9.  On 23 January 2008 I. was interviewed by the investigator. He stated that around May (sic) 2007 he had been sentenced to fifteen days\u2019 imprisonment for disobeying the orders of a police officer. While serving his sentence he had worked on the construction of a house belonging to the applicant, under the direction of Sh. After his release, he had agreed to work for the applicant in return for payment and had carried out construction work for him in June and October 2007. He had then stopped working for the applicant. On 8 November 2007 he had been taken from his home by police officers, who had told him that the applicant had accused him of stealing some cables from the building site. He had been taken to the office of the applicant, who had told him that since he refused to work for money, he would have to work for free. As he had refused to work for free, the applicant had responded that then he would rot in a cell, and had given him a fifteen-day sentence. While he had been serving his sentence, Sh. had taken him out of the detention facility several times and he had worked on the applicant\u2019s construction site: he had refused to build a fence and had done some other work on the site. He had not been remunerated. The applicant had visited the site once and had seen him working but they had not spoken.",
                "10.  On 12 September 2008 I. made a notarised statement to the effect that his statement incriminating the applicant had been given \u201cunder the influence of psychological violence and trickery\u201d (\u0437 \u0437\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f\u043c \u0449\u043e\u0434\u043e \u043c\u0435\u043d\u0435 \u043f\u0441\u0438\u0445\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0456\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0442\u0430 \u043e\u0431\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0443) and that in fact he had worked willingly and for remuneration.",
                "11.  On 30 September 2008 I. was again interviewed by the investigator. The interview was video-recorded. He largely confirmed the tenor of his statement of 23 January 2008 and denied knowingly signing the notarised statement repudiating it. In addition to repeating various elements of his statement of 23 January 2008, he said that although the house where he had worked formally belonged to the applicant\u2019s father, it was the applicant himself who had organised the work. He stressed that he had not been remunerated for his work in April and November 2007 and had not worked voluntarily. In September 2008 the applicant had made him visit a notarial office to formalise some papers, the nature of which he was not clear about.",
                "12.  The applicant and his co-defendant, former police officer G., stood trial before the Vinnytsya Regional Court of Appeal, which was acting as the trial court.",
                "13.  The applicant testified that he had had no connection to his father\u2019s house or work on it. He had not requested that I. be sent there. When convicting I., he had not been aware that the charges against him had been false. I. had worked voluntarily and for remuneration. The applicant did not deny that Sh. had been the construction site manager on the renovation of his father\u2019s house but argued that it had been his father who had been concerned by those works and that the applicant himself had had minimal contact with Sh. The phone number which the prosecution argued he had used to contact Sh. in fact belonged not to him but to his father.",
                "14.  G. admitted that he had forged the administrative arrest report in respect of I. but stated that he had done it at the request of officers B. and S. (see paragraphs 15 and 16 below). He said that the applicant had not been involved and had been unaware of the forgery when convicting I.",
                "15.  B., the head of the detention facility, testified that in late October or early November 2007 the applicant had told him that I. had stolen some things from his construction site and had asked B. to bring I. to him. On 8 November 2007 he had taken I. from his home to the police station. He denied having instructed G. to forge documents in I.\u2019s case. On 12 November 2007 B. was informed by another officer that a stranger claiming to be a court officer showed up at the station and was asking for prisoners to perform works at the court. This was refused. Sometime afterwards the applicant called the station to discuss the release of prisoners and spoke to the commanding officer of the station who gave permission for release of prisoners.",
                "17.  Other police officers testified that Sh. had checked I. out of the facility on several occasions.",
                "18.  P., a District Court officer, stated that he was in charge of taking prisoners from the police detention facility to the District Court to carry out work, and that he knew I. well. However, in November 2007 the latter had not worked at the court.",
                "19.  The applicant\u2019s father confirmed that he had bought the house and had had Sh. perform renovation works on it. He denied knowing I.",
                "20.  On 3 July 2009 the trial court, noting that I. had failed to appear despite the fact that summonses had been duly sent to him, ordered the police to escort I. to the next court hearing on 10 July 2009.",
                "21.  On 8 July 2009 the police reported that I. could not be found at his last known address in Radomyshl and that his whereabouts were unknown. His mother, niece and another neighbour had informed the police that I. had not been living at his usual address in Radomyshl for some time, having left to work in Kyiv. Although he visited briefly from time to time, they had no way of contacting him.",
                "22.  On 24 July 2009 the trial court asked the Zhytomyr regional prosecutor to establish the whereabouts of I. and Sh., and to escort them to the hearing scheduled for 17 September 2009. The prosecutor in turn asked the Security Service for assistance in establishing the whereabouts of those two individuals. On 4 September 2009 the Security Service reported essentially the same information as gathered by the police on 8 July 2009. They also stated that Sh. was not living at his address and his whereabouts were unknown.",
                "23.  On 17 September 2009 the trial court again ordered that the police bring I. to the next court hearing on 29 September 2009. The police could not locate I. at his last known address. His mother gave the same explanation for his absence.",
                "28.  On 22 April 2010 the Supreme Court held a hearing to examine the appeal. No representative for the defence was present. A prosecutor was present and made oral submissions in opposition to the appeal. At the close of the hearing the court ordered that references to Sh.\u2019s statement be struck from the judgment, since he had not signed his pre-trial statement and thus his statement was inadmissible. The court listed the remaining evidence supporting the applicant\u2019s conviction and considered that, other than Sh.\u2019s statement, the evidence was admissible and sufficiently supported the verdict. The court upheld the remainder of the judgment."

                "7.  The applicant applied for asylum under the name of L.B. on 13 August 2009, stating that he had entered Switzerland illegally the same day. He was questioned twice, on 18 August and 24 August 2009, by the Swiss authorities responsible for asylum and migration (until 31 December 2014 the authority was called the Bundesamt f\u00fcr Migration, but it was renamed with effect from 1 January 2015 as the Staatssekretariat f\u00fcr Migration, SEM \u2013 hereafter \u201cthe asylum authorities\u201d). An interpreter was present at both hearings and the record was translated for the applicant prior to his signing it. A member of a non-governmental organisation was present at the second hearing as a neutral witness, in order to guarantee the fairness of the hearing. He had the opportunity to add comments at the end of the record of the hearing about any irregularities, but he made no such observations.",
                "8.  During the hearings the applicant stated that he had attended a number of demonstrations in connection with the presidential election in 2009. He had been arrested during one such demonstration on 15 June 2009 in I. He was subsequently placed in prison, where he was severely tortured every day. After twenty-two days in prison, he was scheduled to appear in court on 6 July 2009. He was placed in a bus with about thirty-five other people but managed to escape during a disturbance caused by one of the other detainees when disembarking from the bus. He then managed to hide with his relatives. After his escape, the authorities had sent a court summons to his home and, when he had failed to appear, the court had sentenced him in absentia to thirty-six months\u2019 imprisonment. He managed to leave the country on 25-26 July 2009 with the help of a smuggler. In support of his account, the applicant submitted copies of his identity card, a court summons of 9 July 2009 and a judgment of 21 July 2009. He explained that the judgment had been sent to his home and that a neighbour had given it to him prior to his departure.",
                "9.  On 4 February 2013 the asylum authorities rejected his asylum application and ordered him to leave Switzerland, finding that his account was not credible as it was contradictory and, in relation to key aspects, not sufficiently substantiated. Despite repeated questions, the applicant had been unable to describe what he had experienced during his imprisonment in a detailed and differentiated manner. He had also contradicted himself regarding his transportation from the prison to court and his escape. Neither his alleged arrest in connection with his participation in a demonstration nor his subsequent detention and escape therefrom had been credible. The documents submitted by the applicant could not lead to a different result as they could easily be bought in Iran and falsified. Moreover, the alleged conduct of the Iranian authorities in sending a court summons to the applicant\u2019s home after his escape, rather than going there to arrest him on the spot, was not credible, nor was his submission that the judgment of 21 July 2009 had been sent to his home and given to a neighbour prior to his departure.",
                "10.  As the applicant did not appeal, the decision became final.",
                "12.  On 17 January 2014 the asylum authorities, who treated the applicant\u2019s request as a second asylum application, questioned the applicant in person. An interpreter was present and the record was translated for the applicant prior to his signing it. A member of a non-governmental organisation was present as a neutral witness in order to guarantee the fairness of the hearing. He had the opportunity to add comments at the end of the record of the hearing if he witnessed any irregularities, but did not make any such observations.",
                "13.  During the hearing, the applicant stated that he had first had contact with a Catholic church in Switzerland in 2011 and then with the Pentecostal church from early 2013. The members of the latter had gradually become his family. One of them had invited him home once or twice a week to familiarise him with the Bible. He had regularly attended church services and after about six or seven months had been baptised in that church. For him, being a Christian meant believing in Jesus Christ and spreading his message. He stated that he continued to study the Bible and recited parts of it. The principle of honesty enshrined in Christianity was particularly important to him. Even if he were unable to manifest his belief in the future, he would always retain the truthfulness of his faith, which nobody could take away from him. He submitted statements that he had attended different churches to support his account. The applicant did not make any submissions regarding the risk allegedly caused by the broken relationship with his father and the latter\u2019s ties to the secret service.",
                "15.  On 31 March 2014 the applicant, represented by a lawyer, appealed against that decision. He pointed out that there had been an increased number of arrests of members of Christian house churches since 2010 and argued that his conversion to Christianity in and of itself exposed him to a real risk of ill-treatment. A Christian convert faced a much greater risk of ill-treatment than those born into the Christian religion. His conversion to Christianity was genuine and lasting. He had first had contact with a Catholic church in Switzerland in 2011 and was serious in practising his faith, as evidenced by the documents he had submitted.",
                "21.  On 13 July 2016 the applicant lodged an appeal against that decision, in substance repeating his earlier submissions. On 30 August 2016 the Federal Administrative Court dismissed the appeal as manifestly ill\u2011founded, fully endorsing the asylum authorities\u2019 reasoning.",
                "22.  On 4 October 2016 the State Secretariat for Migration set a deadline for the applicant\u2019s voluntary departure, which passed on 31 October 2016."

He complained principally about the lack of an effective investigation into the events under Articles 21, 25, 27, 29, 32, 33 and 36 of the Constitution and Articles 3, 6, 13 and 14 of the Convention. On 23 July 2013 his constitutional appeal was rejected by the Constitutional Court, whose decision was served on the applicant on 11 September 2013. The court primarily considered the applicant\u2019s complaints under Article 6 of the Convention and found them to be manifestly ill-founded. As to the applicant\u2019s complaint under Article 3 of the Convention, the Constitutional Court found it to be outside its temporal jurisdiction in view of the date of entry into force of the Constitution itself. In respect of the other complaints, the Constitutional Court held, inter alia, that:\n\u201cit is not enough to allege a violation of one\u2019s rights in a constitutional appeal or list the constitutional rights that are considered to be violated and reasons for their violations based on the appellant\u2019s subjective estimation or evaluation, but to put each mentioned reason into a direct relationship with the allegedly violated constitutional right, and a violation or denial of a certain constitutional right has to be caused by an act or action that occurred before the entry into force of the Constitution. This also implies that specific and detailed reasons of the alleged violation of the constitutional right have to be specified in the constitutional appeal, because only a causal link presented in such manner may compel the Court to find a violation or denial of a certain right.\u201d"

In his recapitulation of the events, the Public Prosecutor mentioned a certain A.V.O., who he claimed to have been involved in the money transactions at issue and to have been threatened by that second criminal organisation.

He further indicated that the unfolding of the events had been corroborated by the statements of all of the accused, but that they had all denied having threatened \u0130.Y. and M.Y.

The same argument was backed, according to the Government, by the conclusions of the medical investigations, which attested to the fact that no urgent need for medical care had been identified in her case (see paragraph 16 below).",

The prosecutor dismissed both complaints on the same day, holding that the measure to remand the applicant in custody was lawful, necessary and proportional to the gravity of the charge. He stated that the order to appear became effective after the house search had been performed, the presence of the applicant during the search being necessary in relation to its conduct and thus outside the limits of such an order. The prosecutor further considered that the time interval during which the applicant was under medical surveillance could not be included within the eight-hour time-limit set out by Article 265 \u00a7 12, as that was an incident excluding the responsibility of the investigating authorities. The limitation of her lawyer\u2019s access to the criminal file had been justified by the necessity to get to the truth and to obtain from the applicant a genuine statement, uninfluenced by those already given by the other suspects or witnesses.",

By a judgment of 9 May 2005 the Buftea District Court convicted N.G. of intellectual forgery, imposed a suspended sentence of six months\u2019 imprisonment and placed her on probation. The court noted that N.G. had given contradictory statements to the prosecutor and to the court with respect to the applicant\u2019s role in the commission of the offence. It held that the statement given to the prosecutor, but not maintained before the court \u2013 according to which the applicant had asked her to antedate the registration of the applications \u2013 was not corroborated by the other pieces of evidence adduced before it.

Afterwards, they had driven her around in the car and finally had taken her to an empty plot of land where she had been raped in the car by one of the police officers. He had been wearing glasses and had held a police radio in his hand. She identified the vehicle\u2019s licence plate.",
                "9.  The applicant and the other police officer were immediately called into the police station for questioning as they had been assigned to the vehicle which had the licence plate identified by S.K.",
                "10.  In his statement to the police, made in the presence of his lawyer, the applicant said that he had picked up S.K. around 2 a.m. while he was patrolling with his colleague, S.A., on Talatpa\u015fa Boulevard. He submitted that S.K., who had looked intoxicated, had hailed them, stopped their car, and told them that she worked as a \u201ckonsomatris\u201d, a bar hostess who entertains male guests by keeping them company. She had asked for their help to go to a safe place and the applicant had offered to take her to her home, which she had declined. According to the applicant they had also offered to take her to the police station, which she had also declined. Finally, they had taken her to S.A.\u2019s home with the intention of sobering her up. The applicant stated that when S.A. was in the kitchen preparing something to eat, S.K. had started behaving strangely, taking off her clothes and acting in a sexually inviting manner. The applicant said that as a result of being aroused he had simply ejaculated in his own hand but had not touched her. He had then called S.A. and told him that they had to leave immediately. The applicant stated that they had left S.K. in front of a hotel at 3 a.m. and had continued with their patrol until they had been called into the police station for questioning.",
                "11.  S.A. confirmed the applicant\u2019s version of events in his statement to the police on the same day.",
                "12.  In an additional statement to the police, also made on the same day, S.K. told the police that she could not remember whether the police officers had taken her to an apartment or some other place as she had been very intoxicated.",
                "13.  A forensic medical examination of S.K. was carried out on the same day, showing that she had no bruises on her body.",
                "14.  A forensic expert report drafted on 15 April 2002 stated that the underwear that the applicant had been wearing on the night in question had S.K.\u2019s and his own DNA on it. Furthermore, napkins found in the rubbish bin on the balcony of S.A.\u2019s apartment had traces of the applicant\u2019s semen.",
                "15.  On 6 June 2002 the Ankara governor decided to authorise the prosecution of the applicant and S.A. for alleged rape and abuse of authority. The applicant lodged an objection with the Ankara District Administrative Court seeking annulment of the governor\u2019s decision, but it was dismissed.",
                "16.  On 15 November 2002 the Ankara public prosecutor filed an indictment with the Ankara Criminal Court of First Instance, charging the applicant and S.A. with abuse of public authority and the unlawful use of a public vehicle under Article 240 of the former Turkish Criminal Code and section 16 of the Law on Vehicles (Law no. 237).",
                "17.  In her statement in the first-instance proceedings, S.K. said that she had flagged down a police car that day to ask for help. As she had been intoxicated, she could not remember exactly what had happened later or which officer had raped her.",
                "18.  The chief public prosecutor submitted an opinion on the merits and stated that the applicant\u2019s conduct should be reclassified as rape and unlawful detention and that of S.A. as having aided and abetted those acts. He therefore argued that the case should be referred to the Ankara Assize Court, which has jurisdiction to hear such charges.",
                "19.  On 13 July 2004 the Ankara Criminal Court of First Instance ruled that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the case. It found that the offences committed by the applicant while performing his official duties were rape and the unlawful detention of an adult, which were governed, inter alia, by Articles 251, 416 \u00a7 1 and 429 \u00a7 1 of the former Criminal Code, and the unlawful use of a public vehicle, which came under section 16 of Law no. 237. It stated that those offences had to be tried by assize courts and it therefore referred the case to the Ankara Assize Court.",
                "20.  At a hearing held on 24 March 2005, the Ankara Assize Court heard S.K. who, contrary to her previous statements, submitted that the officers had not raped her and had not taken her anywhere without her consent. She then submitted that she wished to withdraw her complaint.",
                "21.  On 13 September 2005 the Ankara Assize Court acquitted the applicant and S.A. of all charges, holding that there was no evidence of force on S.K.\u2019s body, one of the constituent elements of the offences of rape and unlawful detention. The court further held that despite S.K.\u2019s statement of 24 March 2005, the forensic report of 15 April 2002 had established that the applicant had had intercourse with her. In the absence of evidence that corroborated the fact of the applicant having forced himself on S.K., it could not be established beyond doubt that the act of sexual intercourse itself had not been consensual. The court stated in that connection that even if S.K. had been drunk that night, her allegations of rape and of being held against her will needed to be supported by some sign of resistance. In the light of the conclusion that there had been no indication of a criminal offence committed by the police officers, the court then held that the applicant and S.A. could not be deemed to have committed the separate offence of the unlawful use of a public vehicle. It therefore acquitted them of all the charges.",
                "22.  On 21 September 2005 the acquittal became final as no appeals had been made.",
                "23.  In the aftermath of the events of 12 April 2002 a preliminary disciplinary investigation was launched against the applicant and S.A. on 24 April 2002.",
                "24.  On 2 and 29 May 2002 the applicant was questioned in relation to the allegations of rape against him. He submitted that he had not had sexual intercourse with S.K. He repeated his earlier statements that S.K. had seduced him to the point where he had had to ejaculate in his own hand. The applicant was also requested to submit a written defence statement. He wrote that he had taken S.K. into the police car with the intention of helping her and had not forced himself on her, as alleged by S.K. He pointed out that the forensic expert evidence had established that there had been no traces of violence, whether on S.K.\u2019s body or in the form of any other type of evidence, such as damage to property or blood stains at S.A.\u2019s apartment or inside the police car.",
                "25.  An investigation report dated 6 June 2002, prepared by the police investigator, concluded that the applicant had committed the offence of rape, while S.A. was guilty of the offence of conduct unbecoming and incompatible with the civil service and therefore recommended that the applicant be sanctioned with a deferral of advancement to a higher rank for a period of twenty-four months. The report further stated that a recommendation for a separate criminal investigation against the applicant and S.A. had already been submitted to the governor\u2019s office for authorisation.",
                "28.  On 4 July 2003 the Ankara Administrative Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s case, holding that the decision to dismiss the applicant from the police force had been in accordance with the law. The relevant parts of the judgment read as follows:\n\u201cActs, conduct and behaviour of the kind listed in section 8(6), \u2018... rape, sexual assault, ... or attempting to commit any of those offences\u2019 and in section 8 (7), \u2018using his position as a police officer for his own or another person\u2019s advantage\u2019, are sanctioned with dismissal from the police force.\nAfter examination of the file, it appears that the case concerns the applicant\u2019s dismissal from the police force on the basis of a disciplinary investigation which established that he had intercourse with a woman without her consent on the pretext of calling her a suspect .., by asking her to get into a police car so that he could verify her identity at the police station, although in the end he took her to a piece of empty land and had intercourse with her without her consent.\nOn the basis of the case file, statements, the forensic report and other information, the veracity of the accusation is reinforced and therefore the decision to dismiss the applicant is in accordance with the law.\u201d",
                "31.  The Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s request on 17 June 2008, holding that none of the reasons for rectification he had put forth fell within the exhaustive list of permissible grounds for such a decision in section 54 (1) of the Administrative Procedure Act (Law no. 2577).",
                "33.  According to the information submitted by the Government, the applicant did not appeal against that decision."

                "6.  During 1991 and 1992 Serbian paramilitary forces gained control of about a third of the territory of Croatia and proclaimed the \u201cSerbian Autonomous Region of Krajina\u201d (Srpska autonomna oblast Krajina, hereinafter \u201cKrajina\u201d). At the beginning of August 1995 the Croatian authorities announced their intention to take military action with the aim of regaining control over Krajina. The operation was codenamed \u201cStorm\u201d (Oluja) and took place from 4 to 7 August 1995. Before the military action, the vast majority of the population of Krajina fled Croatia. Most of them went to Bosnia and Herzegovina but some also went to Serbia. Some returned to Croatia after the war. The number of people who fled is estimated at between 100,000 and 150,000.",

(born in 1942), who was the husband of one of the applicants and the father of the others, lived in Razboji\u0161te, near the larger village of Krupa, on the territory of Krajina. During the night of 4 to 5 August 1995 all the family, save for P.M., fled Croatia. P.M. was killed during Operation Storm on 5 August 1995.\nAccording to the applicants, P.M. was killed in the courtyard of his house in Razboji\u0161te, although he was an unarmed civilian.\nAccording to the Government, he was armed and was killed in an exchange of fire with the Croatian Army in the broader area of Krupa. The villages of Razboji\u0161te, Krupa and \u017degar and the settlement of Mili\u0107i are located near each other.",
                "10.  On June 2002 exhumations were carried out at Gra\u010dac Cemetery. The process was conducted under the auspices of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (Me\u0111unarodni kazneni sud za biv\u0161u Jugoslaviju) and the County State Attorney\u2019s Office in Zadar. Body no. 434 was also dug up and an identity card was found in the name of P.M. The remains were examined at the Institute for Forensic Medicine in Zagreb (Zavod za sudsku medicinu i kriminalistiku) and on 15 October 2002 an autopsy report was issued which concluded that the cause of death had been three wounds from shelling. On 24 November 2003 the third applicant identified the remains as those of her father, P.M.",
                "12.  On 21 October 2005 the police interviewed \u017d.M., who said that P.M. had joined a village guard unit during the war. \u017d.M. did not know who might have killed P.M.",

From 25 May 2006 to 15 June 2007 and from 23 November 2007 to 23 May 2008 he was a Member of Parliament and from 26 December 2007 to 24 March 2010 he was First Deputy Minister of Justice. His father-in-law was President of the Supreme Court of Ukraine from 2006 to 2011.",
                "7.  Between November 2005 and June 2006 and then between June and March 2008 the applicant was one of the equity partners of the law firm Magisters & Partners Ltd (subsequently renamed Magisters Ltd).",

In December 2008 the State-owned joint-stock company Naftogaz Ukrayiny (hereinafter referred to as \u201cNaftogaz\u201d), which was involved in several serious disputes before the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, decided to extend the legal services agreement which it had concluded with Magisters Ltd in 2002 and which was about to expire.",

On 23 February 2009 the applicant, acting in his capacity as First Deputy Minister of Justice, sent a letter to Naftogaz, at the latter\u2019s request, informing it of the existence of exceptional conditions, as provided under domestic law, for purchasing legal services from Magisters Ltd without inviting bids from other law firms. It was noted that Magisters Ltd had been providing Naftogaz with legal services for a long time, including in the proceedings before the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce. Accordingly, changing the legal services\u2019 provider would be costly and unjustified.",
                "10.  The applicant\u2019s letter, which was subsequently submitted to the Economy Ministry, provided the basis for Naftogaz to contract further legal services from Magisters Ltd without pursuing a bidding procedure.",

On 14 September 2009 the Kyiv Pecherskyy District Court (\u201cthe Pecherskyy Court\u201d) quashed the above ruling after a complaint by the applicant. On 21 October 2009 and 15 July 2010 the Kyiv City Court of Appeal (\u201cthe Court of Appeal\u201d) and the Supreme Court, respectively, upheld the first-instance court\u2019s decision.",

On 28 December 2009 the Pecherskyy Court quashed that ruling. Its decision was upheld by the appellate court on 10 February 2010. It appears that it was not challenged on points of law.",

On 20 December 2010 the PGO instructed the Kyiv city police to establish the applicant\u2019s whereabouts and to hand him a summons for questioning at 10 a.m. on 22 December 2010. The letter noted that the applicant had not been present at his address as established by the investigation.",

On 22 December 2010 the PGO instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant under Article 365 \u00a7 3 of the CC (exceeding of powers by an official leading to grave consequences \u2013 see paragraph 39 below). In describing the applicant\u2019s actus reus, the prosecutor found that he had bypassed the registry of the Ministry of Justice when accepting the request from Naftogaz and issuing his letter in reply; that his conclusion about the existence of exceptional conditions for Naftogaz not to pursue a bidding procedure had been in contradiction with the applicable legal provisions; and that he had had no right to put that conclusion on official Ministry of Justice paper. The subsequent extension by Naftogaz of its contract with Magisters Ltd had caused considerable losses to the State budget.",

In particular, the file did not contain sufficient information about the applicant\u2019s health, family and financial situation or his occupation.

                "6.  On 18 May 2006 at 11.45 p.m. several persons arrived by car in front of an Internet caf\u00e9 in Skopje and opened fire with machine guns. According to an expert report admitted in the ensuing proceedings, around 70 bullets were fired towards the caf\u00e9. In the incident three children were killed and six people were seriously injured (\u201cthe victims\u201d).",
                "7.  Following a criminal complaint for murder lodged against unknown perpetrators, on 3 August 2006 the public prosecutor requested that an investigating judge question the victims and a certain B.H. who had allegedly been present at the scene at the time of the shooting.",
                "8.  Between 6 and 19 December 2006 the investigating judge heard oral evidence from the victims and other witnesses. None of them identified the applicants as the perpetrators. Some victims, as well as other witnesses who had arrived at the scene immediately after the shooting, stated that there had been no street lighting and that visibility had been considerably impaired. The investigating judge also heard oral evidence from M.M., who had sold the car used in the incident to two people whom he didn\u2019t know and \u201cwould not recognise if I (he) were to see them now\u201d. He stated that a certain F. had introduced him to the buyers.",
                "9.  During the investigation, there were several unsuccessful attempts by the investigating judge to summons B.H. Assistance from the police was also sought. Having been alerted to the summons and the police inquiry, B.H. appeared in court to testify before the investigating judge. On 27 February and 23 March 2007 he confirmed that he had been present at the scene at the time of the incident and that he had been shot in the upper leg. He had fainted and had spent time recovering in a private hospital outside the respondent State. He stated that there had been four people in the car and that all had fired on the caf\u00e9. He identified a certain Dz. as the driver of the car. He also alleged that he himself had been the most likely target of the attack owing to his alleged involvement in the killing of the applicants\u2019 brother, which had happened at the beginning of 2006. In that context, he had received threats that he would be killed.",
                "10.  On 4 May 2007 two people who had been eye-witnesses to the incident gave oral evidence in the presence of the investigating judge and the public prosecutor. They testified as anonymous witnesses (\u0441\u0432\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043a \u0441\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0440\u0438\u0435\u043d \u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442) under the pseudonyms \u201cKorab\u201d and \u201cVodno\u201d. The latter asked not to have his identity revealed for the following reasons:\n\u201cthe people who committed the crime are violent and have a criminal record and that\u2019s why I\u2019m afraid of their threats; they are armed, convicted, I fear for my life and the life of my family, I fear reprisals.\u201d",
                "11.  On photographs shown in evidence, both witnesses identified one of the applicants as having fired on the caf\u00e9 and Dz. as the driver of the car. \u201cVodno\u201d also identified the other applicant as having fired on the caf\u00e9. He stated that three people (including the applicants) had fired weapons in the incident of 18 May 2006.",
                "12.  On 11 May 2007 another individual was examined before the investigating judge and the public prosecutor under the pseudonym \u201cVardar\u201d for the same reasons as the witness \u201cVodno\u201d. He confirmed that Mr Ramiz Asani (the applicant) had bought the car used in the accident from M.M. He also stated that after the incident Mr Ramiz Asani had told him the following:\n\u201cwhat you\u2019ve seen and heard on television about the incident with M.M.\u2019s car \u2013 I did it in revenge for the killing of my brother ...\u201d",
                "14.  In an indictment of 13 August 2007, the public prosecutor accused the applicants \u2212 who had no previous record, but had criminal proceedings in relation to other charges pending against them \u2212 of having fired machine guns at the Internet caf\u00e9 with the intention of killing B.H. The prosecutor requested that the trial judge examine the victims and several witnesses \u2212 including B.H. and M.M., and the anonymous witnesses \u2212 and to admit other material evidence in evidence, including post-mortem reports and other expert reports.",
                "16.  The trial judge further examined M.M., who did not recognise Mr Ramiz Asani as the buyer of the car used in the incident. He also heard oral evidence from three of 25 witnesses proposed by the applicants regarding their whereabouts at the time when the crime was committed. All three witnesses corroborated the applicants\u2019 version of events, namely that they had been in another local caf\u00e9 at that time.",
                "21.  In public hearings held on 10 October 2008 and 25 September 2009 (latter judgment served on the applicant on 5 January 2010) respectively, the Skopje Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court upheld the applicants\u2019 conviction and the sentence imposed on them. They dismissed appeals lodged by the applicants in which they complained inter alia that the trial court had failed to admit evidence proposed by the defence, that their conviction could not be based solely on the statements of the anonymous witnesses, which had been unlawfully obtained, and that the trial court had not examined B.H. notwithstanding their claims that he would have been available for examination. In this connection they argued that it had been an issue of public record that in the election incidents of 1 June 2008 B.H. had been wounded and hospitalised and later detained by the police.",
                "22.  The courts held that the evidence produced by the anonymous witnesses had been lawfully obtained and that the applicants\u2019 opportunity to put written questions to them had secured their defence rights. The fact that the witnesses had only produced evidence a year after the incident had been due to their fear. Furthermore, they stated that the applicants\u2019 conviction had not been based solely on the evidence produced by those witnesses. In this connection they found that the trial court had admitted other evidence, both documentary and verbal. As regards the evidence produced by B.H., the courts held that the trial court had tried to secure his attendance at the trial, but he had been unavailable for examination, as described in the police note. The higher courts also endorsed the trial court\u2019s finding regarding the applicants\u2019 motive for committing the crime, as established on the basis of the evidence produced by B.H. That had been confirmed by the pre-trial statement of witness F.S. given under pseudonym \u201cVardar\u201d (see paragraph 12 above).",
                "23.  On 2 December 2010 Dz. was found and detained. In subsequent criminal proceedings, he was convicted of murder and sentenced to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment."

It held, amongst other things, that the applicant had acted as the other six plaintiffs\u2019 representative without being able to prove that they were still alive or to identify their heirs, if such heirs existed. Since he was the one who had brought the proceedings, he had a duty to produce evidence in respect of the persons he was representing and was solely responsible for the way he had chosen to formulate his action before the court.

In this connection, it took note of the fact that the examination of prosecution witnesses had been scheduled for 21, 25 and 31 January 2011.

As regards the risk of reoffending, the panel took into account that the applicants were suspected of being part of an organised group that had been operating over a prolonged period of time, with assigned roles in business structures of already existing companies or companies which the suspects aimed to establish with a view to making unlawful gains. The fact that the suspects still held the same posts in the companies implicated in the criminal proceedings implied a risk of reoffending, if they were released.",

They made the following record:\n\u201cFollow-up patient history: According to the patient, about three years ago [in 2011] he started feeling the desire to be in contact with boys, to look like a girl. He dyed his hair to attract attention. He started watching television shows to observe how a woman moves; he uses make-up, dresses up. Since the beginning of last year he has become fixated on these thoughts, and started contemplating the possibility of gender reassignment. During this period he has had mood swings, has been anxious, irritable, [and had] difficulties in focusing his attention. Given these circumstances he was hospitalised in [a psychiatric facility]. After his discharge his condition improved. He continued his studies. In the past year he has started paying more attention to his appearance, using lipstick, wearing women\u2019s jewellery, [and has] sometimes tried on women\u2019s clothing at home. He became acquainted with a boy, a ninth grade student, during one of his walks in the city. He started meeting him, talking to him, tried to \u2018have physical contact\u2019, touched his hand, fondled it. Had a desire to be \u2018caressed\u2019.\nAccording to the supporting documents \u2013 [a report to the head of the police station, the order for a psychiatric ambulance] \u2013 he was apprehended by police officers on the street, where he had been sexually harassing an underage teenager, having stalked him for four months, repeatedly not allowing him to walk away from such encounters. Transferred to [the police station] where he was examined by a psychiatrist on duty, subsequently involuntarily admitted [to the psychiatric hospital] ... During his examination in the reception ward he signed [a document consenting] to treatment ...\nPsychiatric state: Self-aware. Subdued mood. Somewhat distracted. Looks untidy, unkempt hair, dyed ginger. Soft, high-pitched voice. Indisposed to conversation, replies [only] after some pause, does not answer certain questions, asks for some questions to be repeated. While replying he gulps with an expression of pain. Excessive facial expressions during conversation. States that he feels uncontrollable attraction to boys, to be liked by them, to have contact with them. Requests a \u201cspace to meet with a boy\u201d. Blushes while saying this. Considers himself a \u201cfemale person\u201d. Considers in-patient treatment necessary for himself in order to improve his mood, reduce irritability and \u201cperplexity of thoughts\u201d. Denies hallucinations. Denies suicidal thoughts.\nDiagnosis: Schizotypal disorder.\u201d",
                "15.  On 5 May 2014 the Savyolovskiy District Court of Moscow (\u0421\u0430\u0432\u0451\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0443\u0434 \u0433. \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u044b) held a hearing on the premises of the psychiatric facility. The hearing was attended by the applicant, his father and mother, the attending psychiatrist Mr P., the head of one of the Hospital\u2019s departments (Mr L.), the representative of the Hospital (Mrs K.) and the local prosecutor.",
                "16.  During the hearing Mr P., Mr L., and Mrs K. generally advanced the same arguments as those presented in the application for judicial authorisation (see paragraph 14 above), maintaining that the applicant needed to be hospitalised and treated, that he posed a danger to himself and others, and that there was a risk of significant damage to his health in the event of a deterioration in or aggravation of his psychiatric condition in the absence of psychiatric assistance. Mr P. also reported that the applicant considered himself to be healthy and refused treatment, while at the same time \u201cbeing confused, replying to questions with other questions, and being exceptionally insincere\u201d. They also emphasised the fact that the applicant had been apprehended by the police for sexually harassing an underage person.",
                "17.  The applicant\u2019s parents had conflicting opinions about the need for hospitalisation. The mother stated that the applicant did \u201cnot feel well\u201d and had been \u201cirritable lately\u201d, that her communication with him was restricted by the father and that she had not seen him since 10 February 2014. In her opinion, in-patient treatment was necessary. The applicant\u2019s father, acting as his representative, objected to involuntary hospitalisation and did not agree that his son posed any danger to himself or to others. He stated that Mr X was voluntarily following the treatment prescribed by a neurologist and a psychiatrist, that his condition showed signs of improvement and that hospitalisation would interfere with his studies and future career. In his opinion his son had only tried to become friends with \u201cthe boy\u201d, not sexually harass him. He furthermore stated that the police report referred to by the Hospital contained no information on the alleged sexual harassment or other unlawful acts.",
                "18.  The applicant stated the following during the hearing:\n\u201cI refuse treatment and feel myself to be well ... There is nothing special about me. I dyed my hair ginger because that colour suits me, I do not like black. I only wanted to become friends with that boy, nothing special; I tried no clothes on; that is all nonsense. [I want to finish my studies]; I have only two months left and I do not want to be in hospital. I made no statements concerning trying on womens\u2019 clothing or changing gender.\u201d",
                "20.  The applicant\u2019s father appealed. The statement of appeal indicated that the District Court had relied exclusively on the evaluation of the resident psychiatrists, had not addressed inconsistencies in evidence, had failed to substantiate the assertion that the applicant\u2019s condition was severe and that he posed a danger to himself or others, and, lastly, had failed to demonstrate the absence of any alternative treatment options.",
                "21.  On 20 May 2014 the applicant was discharged from the Hospital after an improvement in his mental state.",
                "22.  Certificates issued by the local police station in May 2014 stated that the applicant had not committed any administrative or criminal offence and that he had been referred to psychiatrists because of mental disorders.",
                "23.  On 18 July 2014 the appeal was dismissed by the Moscow City Court (\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0443\u0434). The relevant parts of the decision read as follows:\n\u201c... The case file shows that on 24 April 2014 [a policeman apprehended the applicant]. The police report indicates that [he] had been harassing underage persons ...\nSince the behaviour of [the applicant] exhibited symptoms of mental disorder, [he was taken to the Hospital], where he initially agreed to hospitalisation, stated that since 2013 [he had been subject to] mood changes, and that he [suffered from] anxiety, irritability and difficulties in focusing his attention. Previously he had been hospitalised in [a psychiatric facility]; following his discharge from [that facility] his mental state improved, [and] he had continued his studies. However during the last year the condition re-appeared.\n[According to the medical evidence] on 25 April 2014 [the applicant] was lethargic, sluggish, and had a subdued mood, which he attributed to his inability to meet up with a boy he is attracted to.\nDuring the hearing the representative of [the Hospital] stated that [the applicant] had been brought in in a delusional state, and had talked about \u2018a boy\u2019 who did not [in fact] exist. In this state he had been travelling long distances, presenting a danger to himself and others ...\nThe evidence [submitted to the first-instance court] substantiating the need for involuntary hospitalisation \u2013 including information on previous treatment for his delusional disorder and somatic condition (a second-degree disability) \u2013 constituted legal grounds for involuntary hospitalisation.\nSince the reaching of conclusions regarding the mental health of a person is within the exclusive competence of psychiatrists, the [district] court reasonably gave due regard to the report on the need to provide in-patient treatment to [the applicant] ...\nThe appeal does not refer to any factual information demonstrating that the relatives of [the applicant] or other persons are capable of ensuring his and other persons\u2019 safety without an in-patient treatment regime ...\u201d",
                "24.  The applicant\u2019s subsequent attempts to initiate a review of the above-mentioned judicial decisions proved unsuccessful."

On 28 January 2011 V.\u0160., a convicted prisoner, provided a statement to the Special Investigation Service (Speciali\u0173j\u0173 tyrim\u0173 tarnyba, hereinafter \u201cthe STT\u201d) and stated the following. He had heard from other inmates that the deputy head of Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Correctional Facility, L.D., took bribes to transfer inmates to units with lighter security and that L.D. had mentioned to V.\u0160. that it was possible to be released on probation for money. V.\u0160. was questioned by the STT and stated that in December 2010 L.D. had asked him to his office and enquired whether he wanted to be released early. L.D. had indicated that he had a friend who could help V.\u0160. obtain release on probation and promised to organise a meeting with him. V.\u0160. was asked again that month by L.D. to go to the latter\u2019s office, where he met the applicant (see paragraph 7 below). V.\u0160. asked the applicant what he should do in order to obtain release on probation. The applicant stated that V.\u0160. would first have to be transferred to a unit with lighter security. V.\u0160. asked the applicant how much it would cost him and the applicant replied that Kai\u0161iadorys [District Court] would cost him 7,000 Lithuanian litai (LTL, approximately 2,027 euros (EUR)). After that the applicant indicated several judges that would agree to release V.\u0160. on probation. The applicant also stated that the cost for the same thing in the Kaunas Regional Court would be approximately LTL 10,000 (approximately EUR 2,896) but that that was not the final amount. The applicant also mentioned that V.\u0160. would have to pay LTL 1,000 (approximately EUR 290) for the transfer to a unit with lower security. After that conversation V.\u0160. started recording his discussions with L.D. and the applicant using a voice recorder watch which he said he had obtained from other inmates in exchange for cigarettes. Figures mentioned during the other meetings were LTL 2,000 (approximately EUR 579) for the transfer to another unit and LTL 12,000 (approximately EUR 3,475) for the judges at the Kaunas Regional Court as that amount could be more easily divided in three than LTL 10,000. V.\u0160. stated that no agreement on legal services had been concluded with the applicant. V.\u0160. then contacted an acquaintance, G.T., a former police officer who promised to contact the authorities.",
                "7.  The transcript of the conversation recorded between V.\u0160. and the applicant on 26 January 2011 showed that V.\u0160. had around LTL 35,000 (approximately EUR 10,137). The conversation went as follows:\n\u201cThe applicant: \u2018 ...You understand that the intermediary who will go will also need some, and..\u2019\n...\nThe applicant: \u2018You know, salaries there are [LTL] 7,000, so you know...\u2019\nThe applicant: \u2018As with [D], when he brought, looked, he went there with those pennies, [they] said no, and he did not have any more...\u2019 V.\u0160.: \u2018Listen, I will be honest, for example I said, the deputy head asked me, asked. I told him that I will have ten, ten euros, so to say thirty five litai.\u2019\nThe applicant: \u2018... With that, we can easily talk about Kaunas.\u2019\n...\nThe applicant: \u2018I believe you. I think that it will go through with such an amount of money.\u2019\u201d\nThe applicant told V.\u0160. that that amount might not actually be necessary. V.\u0160. then told the applicant that G.T. would contact him and give him LTL 2,000 (EUR 579). The applicant also told V.\u0160. that he had won a case against Lithuania at the Court and that he had not accepted a bribe in that case. The conversation went as follows:\n\u201cThe applicant: \u2018I have already been burnt and only got things straight in Strasbourg. I have won [in] the Strasbourg Court against Lithuania. I previously worked as a prosecutor.\u2019 V.\u0160.: \u2018The deputy did not tell me anything.\u2019\nThe applicant: \u2018I could go back to being a prosecutor. I have won a case against Lithuania in Strasbourg.\u2019 V.\u0160.: \u2018I will ... shake your hand. I can say ... that this seems unreal to me.\u2019\nThe applicant: \u2018... The prosecutor with a bribe... Strasbourg proved that it was a provocation. I proved it in Strasbourg. The proceedings [there] took eight years.\u2019\nThe applicant: \u2018It was nothing to do with a bribe .... I ... bought an apartment, I asked someone to give me a loan... He ... was in prison later. He was released... and became a snitch.\u2019 V.\u0160.: \u2018A friend\u2019.\nThe applicant: \u2018... He used to sleep at my mother\u2019s place... I don\u2019t know where he disappeared to. He will not die a natural death. I was not the only one he set up. Two judges in Kaunas as well.\u2019\n...\nThe applicant: \u2018And I won a case in Strasbourg later. The Supreme Court rehabilitated me.\u2019 V.\u0160.: \u2018Yes.\u2019\nThe applicant: \u2018The Grand Chamber of seventeen judges, the plenary session for criminal cases.\u2019\n...\nThe applicant: \u2018So look. When will that person come? So that I know what ...\u2019 V.\u0160.: \u2018So I can call you and simply say one word. Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow.\u2019\u201d\nThe applicant asked V.\u0160. to make sure that G.T. did not tell anyone about the agreement and V.\u0160. assured him that G.T. would not ask any questions.",
                "8.  On 31 January the STT asked a prosecutor to apply to a pre-trial judge for authorisation for G.T. and V.\u0160. to offer and give a bribe to L.D. and the applicant, in accordance with the provisions of domestic law. The prosecutor also sought permission to make video and/or voice-recordings, to take pictures and to allow three officers to monitor L.D.\u2019s and the applicant\u2019s telephone conversations. The prosecutor also asked the Vilnius City Second District Court on the STT\u2019s behalf to authorise covert surveillance of the applicant and L.D. for two months. The STT additionally informed the prosecutor that a pre-trial investigation had been opened against L.D. and the applicant.",
                "9.  On the same day the Vilnius City Second District Court authorised taps on the telephones of L.D., V.\u0160., G.T. and the applicant and allowed G.T. and V.\u0160. to perform actions which imitated criminal conduct for two months, until 31 March 2011.

The applicant said that he would call back, but later asked to call the following Tuesday. On 10 February 2011 V.\u0160. called the applicant and said that they would be in touch; he also asked if the applicant would pay him a visit and the applicant said that he would come at some point in the future. On 14 February 2014 V.\u0160. called the applicant and said that he had received a character reference from the psychologist and the applicant stated that he would be in touch. V.\u0160. then asked the applicant whether he should call him and the applicant said that he could call when the documents for his transfer to a unit with lighter security were ready. On 19 February 2011 V.\u0160. called the applicant and informed him that the documents for the court had already been prepared. The applicant stated that he would be in touch and would come to visit V.\u0160. because they could not talk on the telephone. The applicant said that V.\u0160. could call him the following Wednesday or Thursday but then decided that Wednesday would be the best day. On 1-3 March 2011 V.\u0160. called L.D. and complained that he could not reach the applicant and asked for help in finding him. On 3 March 2011 L.D. called a certain A. and asked him where the applicant was. A. told him that it was not the first time that the applicant had disappeared.",
                "16.  On 7 March 2011 L.D. called the applicant and said that people were looking for him. The applicant said that V.\u0160.\u2019s case was still in progress. L.D. asked the applicant to come and meet V.\u0160. and the applicant said that he had understood. V.\u0160. then called the applicant, who said he was going to visit him in a few hours and that they would talk in person. V.\u0160. again called the applicant later that day and asked whether he should bring the medical certificate to the meeting and the applicant said that he was already in the correctional facility. During the visit they discussed the fact that V.\u0160.\u2019s case had not yet been transferred to court. V.\u0160. asked whether the applicant still had the necessary access [in the Kaunas Regional Court]. The applicant confirmed that he did, that the person concerned was coming back from Austria the following Monday and that without that person the matter could not be settled there. The applicant asked whether V.\u0160. wanted him to participate in a hearing before the court of first instance and V.\u0160. said yes. Then they talked about someone else\u2019s situation and the applicant said that he knew the prosecutor and had bought him. The applicant further said that not every prosecutor could be bought but there were two he could buy. V.\u0160. said that he had LTL 30,000 (approximately EUR 8,689) and it did not matter for what [court] he had to pay. The applicant then asked V.\u0160. to speak quieter. He also asked V.\u0160. to call him from time to time. V.\u0160. asked whether he would have to pay something before the hearing in the Kai\u0161iadorys District Court and the applicant said he would not have to give much because the chances were fifty-fifty. The applicant also stated that the rest of the money would be held in reserve for Kaunas [Regional Court] and he would take LTL 1,000 for Kai\u0161iadorys [District Court]. Later in the same conversation he mentioned LTL 1,500 (approximately EUR 434). The applicant asked V.\u0160. to get in touch with his contact person, who was to call and meet the applicant in the evening. After the applicant had left the correctional facility V.\u0160. called him and told him that the papers had been sent to the court on the twenty-third. The applicant asked V.\u0160. to call him in an hour. When V.\u0160. called, the applicant told him that the hearing would take place on 23 March and that the applicant would participate in it; he also asked to call him in the evening.",
                "17.  On 9 March 2011 V.\u0160. called the applicant, who said that he would write him a message. On 14 March 2011 V.\u0160. called the applicant and they again discussed V.\u0160.\u2019s situation. On 17 March 2011 V.\u0160. called the applicant and the applicant said that they would keep in touch after the following Sunday, and V.\u0160. was asked to call on Monday after lunch. On 18 March 2011 V.\u0160. called the applicant, who said that he would not participate in the hearing at the court of first instance regarding V.\u0160.\u2019s release on probation and that if something happened he would inform V.\u0160. On 21 March 2011 V.\u0160. called the applicant, who confirmed his intention as regards the court of first instance because he did not expect anything good to come out of it. However, he said he would try to talk to someone and V.\u0160. said he would not forget his debt to the applicant. On 23 March 2011 V.\u0160. called the applicant and informed him that the Kai\u0161iadorys District Court had decided not to release him on probation. The applicant then said that he would visit V.\u0160. so he could sign an appeal. On 23 March 2011 V.\u0160. called L.D. and asked him to ask the applicant about his chances to be released on probation. L.D. called the applicant the same day and asked how matters were proceeding with their client. The applicant said that he would come on Friday and that they would talk then. On 25 March 2011 the applicant visited V.\u0160., who signed some blank pieces of paper, on which the applicant said he would later write an appeal. V.\u0160. asked whether they would be covered by the amount they had discussed before. The applicant said that he would see, that he had talked with the men in question and asked them to do everything and that they would receive some money. V.\u0160. then told the applicant that his contact person would come the following Monday. After that, they discussed amounts and the applicant told V.\u0160. that the entire sum discussed would be necessary. V.\u0160. asked whether they were talking about thirty [thousand] and whether that amount included the applicant\u2019s share and the applicant said it did. The applicant also said that before that amount would have guaranteed his release on probation one hundred percent but that now there was some trouble. The applicant then told V.\u0160. to call his contact person and ask him to meet the applicant on Monday. V.\u0160. asked whether his person (G.T.) should bring thirty (thousand) and the applicant confirmed that he should.",
                "19.  V.\u0160. was questioned additionally on 30 March 2011. He stated that L.D. had talked of the applicant as a reliable person who had access to prosecutors and judges. V.\u0160. also showed that L.D. had been the first one to start a conversation about the possibility of V.\u0160. being released on probation and that L.D. had told him several times before that \u201cserious men pay money and are released and do not sit in prison\u201d (rimti vyrai moka pinigus ir eina \u012f laisv\u0119, o ne s\u0117di kal\u0117jime).",
                "20.  On 8 April 2011 the Kaunas Regional Court dismissed V.\u0160.\u2019s appeal and upheld the first-instance decision not to release him on probation.",
                "21.  On 9 August 2011 a bill of indictment was drawn up against L.D. and the applicant. The applicant was accused of promising to influence L.D. and the judges at the Kai\u0161iadorys District Court and the Kaunas Regional Court with a bribe so that V.\u0160. would be released on probation. He was also accused of taking a bribe of LTL 2,000 and LTL 30,000 respectively on two occasions.",
                "23.  On 19 October 2011 the Vilnius City Third District Court approved an application by V.\u0160. to be released on probation. The court held that at that time V.\u0160. was serving his sentence in Vilnius Correctional Facility, where he had taken part in the social rehabilitation, legal and social education programmes and had provided information that he would be employed on release.",
                "24.  By a judgment of 18 July 2012 the K\u0117dainiai District Court found the applicant guilty of bribing an intermediary and sentenced him to sixty days in prison. The court found it established that G.T. had given the applicant LTL 2,000 and LTL 30,000 respectively during their meetings on 2 February and 29 March 2011 in return for a promise that the applicant would help in the proceedings for V.\u0160.\u2019s release on probation. The applicant pleaded not guilty and stated that an act of provocation had been organised against him. He also stated that the money he had received was remuneration for his services as V.\u0160.\u2019s lawyer. The applicant said that although no agreement on the provision of legal assistance had been concluded, he had intended to conclude one after the proceedings for V.\u0160.\u2019s release on probation. The applicant refused to provide comments on the recordings and stated that his conversations with V.\u0160. were irrelevant because he had only wanted to show that he was working on his case. Those conversations had not been of any consequence as he had not been able to influence L.D. or the judges at Kai\u0161iadorys District Court and Kaunas Regional Court (Pokalbi\u0173 telefonu ir \u012fra\u0161u su V.[\u0160.] nekomentuoja, paai\u0161kindamas, kad visi jo pokalbiai su V.[\u0160.] buvo d\u0117l aki\u0173, kadangi ka\u017ek\u0105 kalb\u0117ti su V.[\u0160.] reik\u0117jo, tad nieko nerei\u0161kian\u010diais pokalbiais jis tik siek\u0117 parodyti, kad dirba, ta\u010diau tuo jis nesiek\u0117 sukelti joki\u0173 pasekmi\u0173, kadangi negal\u0117jo paveikti nei L.[D.], nei Kai\u0161iadori\u0173 apylink\u0117s ar Kauno apygardos teismo teis\u0117j\u0173). G.T. stated that he had known V.\u0160. since 2000 and that V.\u0160. had called him and asked for help. When G.T. had gone to Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Correctional Facility, V.\u0160. had told him that the applicant required money and that V.\u0160. doubted that the money would be used in the proper way.\nThe court\u2019s conclusions were based on the evidence given by V.\u0160., G.T., L.D. and other employees of Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s Correctional Facility. It also addressed the secret recordings of the applicant\u2019s conversations, including those recorded prior to the authorisation for actions imitating criminal conduct. The court held that the transcripts of the conversations between the applicant and V.\u0160. showed that the applicant had been the first to indicate the amounts of money to be paid. The applicant\u2019s statement that he had been going to conclude an agreement on legal services after he had taken LTL 30,000 were refuted by his conversation with G.T., where the applicant had stated that in case of failure he would keep 20% of the money and return the rest. The video-recordings showed that the applicant had not counted the money and that he had indicated to G.T. to put it in the side pocket of the car door. That allowed the court to draw the conclusion that the applicant realised that the money was remuneration for his criminal activity. The court further held that V.\u0160.\u2019s testimony, voice and video\u2011recordings showed that the applicant had not been incited to take a bribe and that the criminal conduct simulation model had been applied within the limits prescribed by the court (see paragraph 12 above). By the same judgment the K\u0117dainiai District Court found L.D. guilty of abuse of office and forgery, which had allowed V.\u0160. to be transferred to a unit with lighter security (see paragraph 10 above). It ordered L.D. to pay a fine of LTL 12,480 (approximately EUR 3,614). L.D. pleaded guilty, but stated that V.\u0160. had named the applicant as a lawyer that could help him obtain release on probation. The court decided to return the recorder watch to V.\u0160.",
                "25.  The applicant and L.D. lodged an appeal. The applicant argued that the provisions of domestic law had been applied incorrectly, that V.\u0160. and G.T. used undue pressure, and that V.\u0160. had used unauthorised equipment, the recorder watch, which he had not been allowed to have in prison. The applicant asked the appellate court to question V.\u0160. and ask him how he had acquired such a watch in a correctional facility. The applicant also stated that L.D. had overseen matters relating to V.\u0160.\u2019s transfer to a unit with lighter security and that there was no evidence that he had tried to bribe L.D. The applicant also stated that he had never named any specific person in the courts whom he would have bribed because he had not intended to perform such an act. He had only talked to V.\u0160. about the outcome of the proceedings for release on probation because V.\u0160. had called him constantly.",
                "27.  The Panev\u0117\u017eys Regional Court held an oral hearing where several witnesses, including V.\u0160., had been questioned. On 13 June 2013 the Panev\u0117\u017eys Regional Court held that V.\u0160. had purchased the watch for his personal use and that the provisions of domestic law did not directly prohibit the use of such equipment in prison. The court also held that the initial contact between V.\u0160. and the applicant had been arranged by L.D., that V.\u0160. had not known the applicant beforehand and had not had any motive to incite him to commit a crime. The court also found that no agreement on the provision of legal services had been concluded between the applicant and V.\u0160. and that the applicant\u2019s argument that he had intended to conclude one later had been dismissed as an attempt to improve his situation. On the basis of the audio-recordings, the court also observed that the applicant had been the first to say that he could settle the matter for money. The court also found that there had been no incitement and that the authorities had not put any active pressure on the applicant to commit an offence. On the contrary, the applicant had incited V.\u0160. to give him an amount that would be sufficient for himself, an intermediary and three court judges. The court also held that at the time the offence had been committed, Article 226 \u00a7 1 of the Criminal Code provided for two alternative sentences for bribery of an intermediary: arrest or imprisonment for up to three years. On 5 July 2011 the Criminal Code had been amended and the applicant\u2019s offence had then satisfied the requirements of Article 226 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code, which provided for various sentences: a fine, arrest or imprisonment for up to five years. As the provision in force provided for a more lenient sentence, the court decided to impose a fine of LTL 65,000 (approximately EUR 18,825). The court dismissed L.D.\u2019s appeal by the same judgment.",
                "29.  On 28 January 2014 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law. The court held that the pre-trial investigation had been opened on 28 January 2011 upon the request of V.\u0160. Together with his testimony, V.\u0160. had given the authorities his voice-recording watch, where he had recorded his conversations with L.D. and the applicant. The court held that convicted prisoners who used voice recorders breached internal prison regulations, but that did not mean that officers who carried out a pre\u2011trial investigation and obtained information from such a voice recorder acted unlawfully. The court also held that the finding of the applicant\u2019s guilt had not been based solely on the evidence obtained from V.\u0160.\u2019s watch. The court observed that L.D. had suggested the applicant as a lawyer because he knew the prosecutors and judges dealing with V.\u0160.\u2019s case, while L.D. had not incited the applicant to take bribes. By the same judgment the Supreme Court left an appeal on points of law by L.D. unexamined because therein he had raised arguments that had not been raised before the appellate court.",
                "30.  On 19 December 2014 the Supreme Court examined an application by the applicant to reopen the proceedings. It decided not to do so, but reduced the fine to LTL 13,000 (approximately EUR 3,765)."

He maintained that if they had seen any injury on the applicant\u2019s face following interrogation, they would surely have inquired of him whether he had been ill-treated by the police officers.

As a general rule, the witnesses explained that they would not admit a detainee into the prison if he showed signs of injuries. Examining the photos of the applicant, two of the medical staff stated that because of the bad quality of the photos, they weren\u2019t even sure if they showed actual injuries or simply the shape of the applicant\u2019s face, while the third asserted that the injury must have been fresh when the photo was taken.",
