                "P.W.2 has clearly identified the accused at the time of the identification parade.",

                "If this contention has got to be accepted in every case where the employees attack the managerial personnel, as their photographs would be available in the registers, then, in each and every case of this nature, the arrest and test identification parade has got to be eschewed.",
                "In the instant case, without <ENTITY> lapse of time and that too within a period of three days test identification parade has been conducted in which P.W.2 has identified the accused and this would clearly point out that he saw the assailants during the attack on him.",
