                "If this contention has got to be accepted in every case where the employees attack the managerial personnel, as their photographs would be available in the registers, then, in each and every case of this nature, the arrest and test identification parade has got to be eschewed.",
                "In the instant case, without <ENTITY> lapse of time and that too within a period of three days test identification parade has been conducted in which P.W.2 has identified the accused and this would clearly point out that he saw the assailants during the attack on him.",

                "The offence committed by the appellant cannot be held to be a murder but at the most would be culpable homicide <ENTITY> amounting to murder, falling under Exception 1 to <SECTION>, <ACT> As we have pointed out hereinabove, on taking into consideration the weapon used and the vital organs on which blows of knife were given causing 3 incised wounds and <ENTITY> stab wound to the deceased, inevitable conclusion which can be arrived at is that the intention of accused was to murder his wife.",

                "On the contrary, the nature of injuries also suggests that the injuries could <ENTITY> have been inflicted while <ENTITY> was asleep, and even <ENTITY> (PW 1) and deceased <ENTITY> herself also do <ENTITY> speak about the injuries having been caused while <ENTITY> was asleep and the finding reached by the learned Additional Sessions Judge was, therefore, <ENTITY> sustainable.",

                "The learned Additional Sessions Judge further also relied upon the report (Ex. 14) lodged by the appellant himself at Police Station, Arni wherein it has been stated that on 6-2-1986 at about 4 a.m. in the morning when his wife was asleep, because of her bad character the appellant delivered two blows on her stomach with iron knife.",
                "Mr. <ENTITY> contended before us that the statement in the report (Ex. 14) ought <ENTITY> to have been relied upon by the learned Additional Sessions Judge as it was of incriminating nature and in <ENTITY> case since the appellant in his statement under <SECTION>, <ACT> had stated that this oral report was <ENTITY> correctly recorded by the police, it could <ENTITY> have been relied upon <ENTITY> coming to the conclusion that the appellant had assaulted his wife by means of knife while she was asleep, particularly when there was other positive evidence on record to indicate that the assault was made while <ENTITY> was asleep and further particularly when even <ENTITY> herself has <ENTITY> told to <ENTITY> (PW 1) and others that she was assaulted when she was asleep.",
                "The aforesaid submission of Mr. <ENTITY>, the learned counsel <ENTITY> the appellant, appears to be justified to us having regard to the evidence of <ENTITY> (PW 1) and <ENTITY> (P.W. 2) and the nature of the injuries inflicted upon the deceased and we feel that the assault must <ENTITY> have been made by the appellant while <ENTITY> was asleep.",
                "Having arrived at this conclusion and having regard to the prosecution case itself that the appellant was doubting the fidelity of <ENTITY>, we also feel that in <ENTITY> case probability of there being a quarrel between the appellant and his wife before the incident, the appellant's saying therein that she should <ENTITY> go with some other persons and giving of reply by <ENTITY> that she would accompany <ENTITY> other person as he was impotent and thereby the appellant depriving of the power of self-control due to grave and sudden provocation caused by the charge of impotency, resulting into attacking his wife, cannot be ruled out.",
                "Merely because the appellant did <ENTITY> state in his statement that the quarrel took place between him and his wife immediately before the incident and <ENTITY> provoked him by saying that he was impotent and on the other hand he had taken and defence that he was <ENTITY> present when the alleged incident occurred, the appellant cannot be deprived from the benefit of doubt arising from the circumstances which can be gathered from the prosecution evidence itself and the learned Additional Sessions Judge, in the circumstances, in our opinion, was <ENTITY> justified in <ENTITY> accepting this plea of grave and sudden provocation bringing his case under <SECTION>, <ACT> on consideration of the entire evidence on record, we find that the appellant in the circumstances is entitled to the benefit of doubt as the possibility of there being quarrel between him and his wife immediately before the incident and the assault being the result of grave and sudden provocation by his wife saying that he was impotent, cannot be ruled out.",
