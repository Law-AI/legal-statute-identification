Added further the learned counsel that there was a grave chargeagainst the appellant that he committed sexual assault on P.W.1; that the caseof the prosecution was that he made her wait near the union office and thattoo at about 1.00 p.m.; that the way in which the prosecution has broughtforth the case was that he took her by placing her in front of the cycle; thathe took her from the union office to a place aside; that the <ENTITY> wouldimprobablise the case of the prosecution; that the <ENTITY> place where P.W.1 waswaiting <ENTITY> the accused is a busy crowded locality; that the appellant wasworking as Sub Inspector of Police at that time, and hence, it would be highlyimprobable that he took her in his cycle to a aloof place and committed sexualassault on her; that the whole case of rape was thoroughly belied by theevidence of P.W.2; that P.W.2 has categorically deposed that P. W.1 came tothe police station to meet him <ENTITY> the first time at about 5.00 p.m. on27.7.1989 and hence, the case of the prosecution that she came to the policestation in morning and the appellant asked her to wait near the union officeat 1.00 p.m. where from he took her to a aloof place and committed sexualassault on her was nothing but a false story; that even the medical evidencehas <ENTITY> supported the prosecution case; that P.W.29 Doctor, who was examinedby the prosecution, has categorically spoken to the fact that she did <ENTITY> findany symptom of rape; that she has also recorded a statement of P.W.1 victim,wherein P.W.1 has spoken about the attempt of rape, but <ENTITY> the act of rape;that this would also indicate the falsity of the evidence of P.W.1; that boththe witnesses, namely, P.Ws.1 and 2, who were originally examined before thetrial court, have turned hostile; that again on their application before thecourt, the <ENTITY> was scraped and the evidence was recorded <ENTITY> the second time,but both the witnesses have <ENTITY> tendered <ENTITY> explanation as to which led themto give evidence otherwise and <ENTITY> in the line of the prosecution case andturned hostile on the earlier occasion; that this would also cast a doubt ontheir evidence; that it is true that in a case of rape, the prosecution canrely on the evidence of victim/the prosecutrix, but in this case, her evidencewas <ENTITY> free from doubt and that her evidence has been thoroughly belied fromthe evidence of P.W.2 .",
                "Strongly opposing all the contentions put forth by the appellant'sside, the learned Government Advocate (Criminal Side) would contend that thelower court only on appreciation of the evidence has found the accused guilty;that P.W.1 victim has categorically deposed and narrated the whole incident;that she has given a cogent evidence and it would be sufficient in a case ofrape like this; that P.W.2's evidence is of no consequence; that P.W.2 wasenquired by the Revenue Divisional Officer within a short span of time wherehe has clearly spoken that his wife came to the police station in morning;that the evidence given by him before the court after a decade need <ENTITY> begiven much weight; that the medical evidence adduced through P.W.29 Doctor andthe accident register Ex.P.34 would clearly indicate that the act of rape wascompleted; that this medical evidence coupled with the evidence of P.W.1 wouldclearly indicate that the accused/appellant, who was the Sub Inspector ofPolice at that time and was to protect the law, has committed sexual assaulton the victim; that the prosecution has also proved through P.W.1's evidencethat it was the appellant who took her to a aloof place and committed the actof rape; that the prosecution has produced necessary evidence <ENTITY> proving theoffence of extortion by the appellant/accused, and thus, the lower court haselaborately discussed both factual and legal aspects in the matter and hasarrived at a correct conclusion, and hence, the judgment of the lower courthas got to be confirmed.",
